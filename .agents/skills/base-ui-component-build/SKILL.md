description: Build a new Material UI component on top of a Base UI (`@base-ui/react`) part, from package source through theme registration, tests, and docs demos, following a shape the team approved with base-ui-component-shape. Use when implementing a Material UI component whose behavior comes from Base UI, such as a preview card, meter, OTP field, or menubar.

# Build a Material UI component on Base UI

Base UI owns behavior; Material UI owns presentation.
The finished component is _indistinguishable_ from any other Material UI component in theming, imports, tests, and docs.
The only new thing is the Base UI part underneath.

Scope: **new components**, ones Material UI has never had (for example: number field, preview card, menubar).
A Base UI successor to an existing component (Menu v2 replacing Menu) ships under `Unstable_<Name>2` subpaths with a migration guide; this skill does not cover it.

`<Name>` below stands for the component name, such as `PreviewCard`; `<name>` is its camelCase form and `<kebab-name>` its kebab-case form.

## API rules

These rules were decided by the Material UI team on 2026-11-04. Apply every one of them.

1. **`render`, not `component`.** Parts that change their rendered element take a public `render` prop. A **standalone trigger**, which users place and style themselves, requires `render`, because users choose the element they want (`<PreviewCardTrigger render={<Button>Open</Button>} />`). It also passes `children` through to Base UI, which places them inside the `render` element; blocking them takes more code than it saves. Keep standalone trigger `children` out of the docs, demos, and API page. A **styled trigger**, which the component lays out and styles (the triggers in a menubar row), is a styled part like any other: `render` is optional and its `children` are its documented content. No part accepts `component`. On a styled part, `render` keeps the part's styles; `slots.root` replaces them (see [references/adapter.md](references/adapter.md#public-render)).
2. **Merged parts use slots.** Which parts are public is the approved shape's decision. When it merges several Base UI parts into one public part, as a popup wraps Portal, Positioner, and Popup, `slots` and `slotProps` reach each merged part.
3. **Flat names.** Export PascalCase parts (`PreviewCardTrigger`). There is no namespace object (`PreviewCard.Trigger`).
4. **Base UI names for behavior.** Props for logic and event handlers keep Base UI names and signatures (`onOpenChange(open, eventDetails)`, `side`, `align`, `delay`), selected from Base UI types with `Pick`. Presentation props keep Material UI names (`size`, `color`, `variant`, `elevation`, `disableRipple`).
5. **Styling hooks.** Utility classes and `ownerState` carry live Base UI state. The Base UI data attributes are re-exported from Base UI and documented. Users style live state with these classes and data attribute constants in `styleOverrides`; `variants` match props only.
6. **Stable exports.** Each public part is a `@mui/material/<Name><Part>` subpath and a root `@mui/material` export, with a `Mui<Name><Part>` theme key.

## Steps

### 1. Read the approved shape

Find the RFC that `base-ui-component-shape` produced. By default it is `.shape/<kebab-name>/<kebab-name>-shape.md` in the checkout that ran the shape skill; when the author published it (an issue, a discussion, or a PR), read it from the link they give. Read its "Approved shape" section: the approved part table, with each fork's decision applied. If there is no RFC, or that section is empty, stop and ask the author to run `base-ui-component-shape` and get the team's decision first.

Read the Base UI docs and types for the component. They ship with the package installed for the docs: `docs/node_modules/@base-ui/react/docs/react/components/<kebab-name>.md` and `docs/node_modules/@base-ui/react/<kebab-name>/**/*.d.ts`.

Then read the reference for the approved shape:

- One public component configured by props, like `TextField` or `LinearProgress`: [references/single-component.md](references/single-component.md).
- Several public parts that users compose (a trigger, a popup, items): [references/compound-parts.md](references/compound-parts.md).

Done when a table that matches the approved part table, written into the PR description (or your final report when there is no PR), lists every export of the Base UI component (every part, plus helpers such as `createHandle`) with its role, named as in the shape RFC: `public part <Name><Part>` (for a trigger, followed by `standalone trigger` or `styled trigger`), `slot of <Name><Part>`, `prop of <Name><Part>`, or `not exposed: <reason>`. Each rendered row names the existing Material UI component it builds on (`Paper`, `ButtonBase`, `FormControl`, `List`) or says it is a new styled element, and gives its slot name.

### 2. Write the types

Follow [references/adapter.md](references/adapter.md#types).

Done when every public prop of every part is accounted for as one of: a picked Base UI prop, a Material UI presentation prop, a common prop (`render`, `slots`, `slotProps`, `classes`, `className`, `style`, `sx`), or an HTML attribute of the rendered element, and each declared prop has a JSDoc comment.

### 3. Implement each part

Read [references/verify.md](references/verify.md) once, then follow [references/adapter.md](references/adapter.md).
Every Base UI part renders through its `render` callback into a Material styled slot, and every slot goes through `useSlot`.

Done when each row of the step 1 table has its part or slot implemented, and no Base UI prop reaches the DOM unless it was picked.

### 4. Register the component

Follow [references/registration.md](references/registration.md): classes, data attributes, theme types, exports, and the `@base-ui/react` dependency.

Done when a `createTheme({ components: { Mui<Name><Part>: { defaultProps, styleOverrides, variants } } })` call type-checks for every styled part, and every part imports from both its subpath (`@mui/material/<Name><Part>`, or `@mui/material/<Name>` for a single component) and `@mui/material`.

### 5. Test

Follow [references/testing.md](references/testing.md).

Done when every rendered part passes `describeConformance`, every behavior the docs page shows has a test through the Material UI part, and each re-exported data attribute is asserted in a test.

### 6. Document

Follow [references/docs.md](references/docs.md).
The docs demos are the proof that the component works: each one must render in the browser.

Done when the page has a demo for each feature in the Base UI docs that the component exposes, plus a customization section, and every demo renders without console errors.

### 7. Verify

Run, in this order:

1. `pnpm proptypes`, then `pnpm docs:api`. Both write files; keep their output.
2. `pnpm prettier`. `docs:api` writes JSDoc into component files, so format after it.
3. `pnpm typescript` and `pnpm test:unit <Name>`.
4. `pnpm exec eslint --max-warnings 0 --no-warn-ignored <changed files>`, listing the changed files with `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d <base>`. The full `pnpm eslint` run also reports errors from outside your change.

Then go through every check in [references/verify.md](references/verify.md).

Done when every command passes and every check in `verify.md` is ticked, with the evidence (test name, command output, or file and line) written next to it in your final report. A check that cannot apply to the component (item checks for a meter) is marked `N/A: <reason>` instead. The report also tells the author that the component is not in the accessibility suite yet (see [references/testing.md](references/testing.md#visual-and-accessibility)).
