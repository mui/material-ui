# Scripts

## Release

### Prerequisites

1. You must be a member of the `@mui` org in npm to publish the release
2. Set up your npm authToken by logging into npm (`npm login`) . This will save a token to `~/.npmrc` as a line that looks
   like this:
   ```text
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```
3. Make sure you have added the `material-ui-docs` remote to deploy the documentation:
   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```
4. Generate a GitHub Token at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new and add it to your shell rc script (either `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Releasing a minot version

A minor release goes like this:

#### Prepare

The following steps must be proposed as a pull request.

1. Generate the changelog with `pnpm release:changelog`
   The output must be prepended to the top level `CHANGELOG.md`
   `pnpm release:changelog --help` for more information. If your GitHub token is not in your env, pass it as `--githubToken <my-token>` to the above command.

2. Clean the generated changelog:
   1. Match the format of https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases.
   2. Change the packages names casing to be lowercase if applicable
3. Update the root `/package.json`'s version
4. Run `pnpm release:version`. Keep in mind:
   1. Only packages that have changes since the last release should have their version bumped.
   2. If they have changes, packages that follow Material-UI's versioning scheme should be bumped to the same version as the root `package.json`. This might require skipping some version numbers.
5. Open PR with changes and wait for review and green CI
6. Merge PR once CI is green and it has been approved

#### Release

1. Checkout the last version of the release branch
2. `pnpm install && pnpm release:build` (make sure you have the latest dependencies installed, and build the packages)
3. `pnpm release:publish` (release the versions on npm, you need your 2FA device)
4. `pnpm release:tag` (push the newly created tag)

#### Documentation

`pnpm docs:deploy` to deploy the documentation (it lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/) with the latest changes.
Force push if necessary.

#### Announce

After the docs is live, follow the instructions in https://mui-org.notion.site/Releases-7490ef9581b4447ebdbf86b13164272d.

### Releasing a patch version

A patch release could happen if there is a regression fix that could not wait for the monthly release cycle.

It goes like this:

#### Prepare

Checkout the latest minor release tag and create a branch "release/PATCH_VERSION". Cherry-pick the necessary commit on this branch. The following steps must be proposed as a pull request.

1. Generate the changelog with `pnpm release:changelog`
   The output must be prepended to the top level `CHANGELOG.md`
   `pnpm release:changelog --help` for more information. If your GitHub token is not in your env, pass it as `--githubToken <my-token>` to the above command.

2. Clean the generated changelog:
   1. Match the format of https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases.
   2. Change the packages names casing to be lowercase if applicable
3. Update the root `/package.json`'s version
4. Run `pnpm release:version`. Keep in mind:
   1. Only packages that have changes since the last release should have their version bumped.
   2. If they have changes, packages that follow Material-UI's versioning scheme should be bumped to the same version as the root `package.json`. This might require skipping some version numbers.
5. Open PR with changes and wait for review and green CI
6. Merge PR once CI is green and it has been approved

#### Release

1. Checkout the last version of the release branch
2. `pnpm install && pnpm release:build` (make sure you have the latest dependencies installed, and build the packages)
3. `pnpm release:publish` (release the versions on npm, you need your 2FA device)
4. `pnpm release:tag` (push the newly created tag)

#### Documentation

Run `git push -f material-ui-docs HEAD:latest` to deploy the documentation (it lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/) with the latest changes.
Force push if necessary.

#### Cleanup

After the release is done, merge the branch back to master. While merging make sure to resolve conflicts considering master may have future changes done in the same files.

#### Announce

After the docs is live, follow the instructions in https://mui-org.notion.site/Releases-7490ef9581b4447ebdbf86b13164272d.

## Deploy documentation without a release

Sometimes it is necessary to deploy the selected commit(s) without
deploying all the changes that have been merged into the main branch
since the previous release (for example publishing a blog post or releasing
urgent docs updates).

**Note:** The instructions below are for deploying to the `latest` branch of the `material-ui-docs` repository, which points to `https://mui.com/`. If you need to deploy to a different subdomain, replace `latest` with the appropriate branch name:

- `latest`: `https://mui.com/`
- `next`: `https://next.mui.com/`
- `v*.x`: `https://v*.mui.com/`

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Add the `material-ui-docs` remote if you haven't done this already:

   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```

2. Fetch the latest changes from the `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch material-ui-docs latest
   ```

3. Switch to the `latest` branch from `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git switch --detach material-ui-docs/latest
   ```

4. Cherry-pick the commit(s) that you want to include in the new deployment:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit>
   ```

   It will commit the changes if there are no conflicts.

   In case of conflicts you will need to resolve them and commit the changes manually.

   If this command fails with the message 'bad revision', it means that the commit doesn't exist on your local repository.
   The commit might have been created on a remote branch, probably when merging into `master` or `v*.x`.
   In this case, you'll have to fetch the latest changes of the corresponding remote branch and then try again.

5. Push the changes to the `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git push material-ui-docs HEAD:latest
   ```

6. Switch from detached `HEAD` back to your last checked out branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -
   ```
