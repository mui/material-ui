# Scripts

## Release

### Prerequisites

1. You must be a member of the `@mui` org in npm to publish the release
2. Set up your npm authToken by logging into npm (`npm login`) . This will save a token to `~/.npmrc` as a line that looks
   like this:
   ```text
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```
3. Make sure you have added the `material-ui-docs` remote to deploy the documentation:
   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```
4. Generate a GitHub Token at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new and add it to your shell rc script (either `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Releasing a minor version

A minor release goes like this:

#### Prepare

The following steps must be proposed as a pull request.

1. Generate the changelog with `pnpm release:changelog`
   The output must be prepended to the top level `CHANGELOG.md`
   `pnpm release:changelog --help` for more information. If your GitHub token is not in your env, pass it as `--githubToken <my-token>` to the above command.

2. Clean the generated changelog:
   1. Match the format of https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases.
   2. Change the packages names casing to be lowercase if applicable
3. Update the root `/package.json`'s version
4. Run `pnpm release:version`. Keep in mind:
   1. Only packages that have changes since the last release should have their version bumped.
   2. If they have changes, packages that follow Material-UI's versioning scheme should be bumped to the same version as the root `package.json`. This might require skipping some version numbers.
5. Open PR with changes and wait for review and green CI.
6. Merge PR once CI is green and it has been approved.

#### Release

1. Go to the [publish action](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
2. Choose "Run workflow" dropdown

   > - **Branch:** master
   > - **Commit SHA to release from:** the commit that contains the merged release on master. This commit is linked to the GitHub release.
   > - **Run in dry-run mode:** Used for debugging.
   > - **Create GitHub release:** Keep selected if you want a GitHub release to be automatically created from the changelog.

3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Refresh the page to see the newly created workflow, and click it.
5. The next screen will say "@username requested your review to deploy to npm-publish", click "Review deployments" and authorize your workflow run. **Never approve workflow runs you didn't initiaite.**

#### Documentation

`pnpm docs:deploy` to deploy the documentation (it lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/) with the latest changes.
Force push if necessary.

#### Publish GitHub release

After the documentation deployment is done, review the draft release that was created, then publish it. At this point the release tag gets created. [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases)

#### Announce

After the docs is live, follow the instructions in https://mui-org.notion.site/Releases-7490ef9581b4447ebdbf86b13164272d.

### Releasing a hotfix version

A hotfix release could happen if there is a regression fix that could not wait for the monthly release cycle and the master branch already contains not yet to be released commits. If you can publish an earlier minor or patch, just prefer that over a hotfix release.

It goes like this:

#### Prepare

Hotfix branch creation requires the help of a repository admin. They need to take the following steps:

1. Check out the commit for the latest release tag.
2. Create a branch named _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_ where _<PATCH_VERSION>_ is the next semver patch version from that release tag.
3. force push the branch to `upstream`:

   ```bash
   git push -f upstream release/<PATCH_VERSION>
   ```

The following steps must be proposed as a pull request to _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_.

1. check out _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_ and cherry-pick the hotfix commits on top of it.
2. Generate the changelog with `pnpm release:changelog`
   The output must be prepended to the top level `CHANGELOG.md`
   `pnpm release:changelog --help` for more information. If your GitHub token is not in your env, pass it as `--githubToken <my-token>` to the above command.
3. Clean the generated changelog:
   1. Match the format of https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases.
   2. Change the packages names casing to be lowercase if applicable
4. Update the root `/package.json`'s version
5. Run `pnpm release:version`. Keep in mind:
   1. Only packages that have changes since the last release should have their version bumped.
   2. If they have changes, packages that follow Material-UI's versioning scheme should be bumped to the same version as the root `package.json`. This might require skipping some version numbers.
6. Open PR with changes and wait for review and green CI.
7. Merge PR into _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_ once CI is green and it has been approved.
8. Open and merge a PR from _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_ to master to correct the package versioning and update the changelog.

#### Release

1. Go to the [publish action](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
2. Choose "Run workflow" dropdown

   > - **Branch:** _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_
   > - **Commit SHA to release from:** the commit that contains the merged release on _release/<PATCH_VERSION>_. This commit is linked to the GitHub release.
   > - **Run in dry-run mode:** Used for debugging.
   > - **Create GitHub release:** Keep selected if you want a GitHub release to be automatically created from the changelog.

3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Refresh the page to see the newly created workflow, and click it.
5. The next screen shows "@username requested your review to deploy to npm-publish", click "Review deployments" and authorize your workflow run. **Never approve workflow runs you didn't initiaite.**

#### Documentation

Run `git push -f material-ui-docs HEAD:latest` to deploy the documentation (it lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/) with the latest changes.
Force push if necessary.

#### Publish GitHub release

After the documentation deployment is done, review and then publish the release that was created in draft mode during the release step [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases)

#### Cleanup

After the release is done, merge the branch back to master. While merging make sure to resolve conflicts considering master may have future changes done in the same files.

#### Announce

After the docs is live, follow the instructions in https://mui-org.notion.site/Releases-7490ef9581b4447ebdbf86b13164272d.

## Deploy documentation without a release

Sometimes it is necessary to deploy the selected commit(s) without
deploying all the changes that have been merged into the main branch
since the previous release (for example publishing a blog post or releasing
urgent docs updates).

**Note:** The instructions below are for deploying to the `latest` branch of the `material-ui-docs` repository, which points to `https://mui.com/`. If you need to deploy to a different subdomain, replace `latest` with the appropriate branch name:

- `latest`: `https://mui.com/`
- `next`: `https://next.mui.com/`
- `v*.x`: `https://v*.mui.com/`

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Add the `material-ui-docs` remote if you haven't done this already:

   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```

2. Fetch the latest changes from the `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch material-ui-docs latest
   ```

3. Switch to the `latest` branch from `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git switch --detach material-ui-docs/latest
   ```

4. Cherry-pick the commit(s) that you want to include in the new deployment:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit>
   ```

   It will commit the changes if there are no conflicts.

   In case of conflicts you will need to resolve them and commit the changes manually.

   If this command fails with the message 'bad revision', it means that the commit doesn't exist on your local repository.
   The commit might have been created on a remote branch, probably when merging into `master` or `v*.x`.
   In this case, you'll have to fetch the latest changes of the corresponding remote branch and then try again.

5. Push the changes to the `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git push material-ui-docs HEAD:latest
   ```

6. Switch from detached `HEAD` back to your last checked out branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -
   ```
