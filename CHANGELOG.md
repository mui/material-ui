## 0.12.0
###### _Sep 25, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Theming has been re-done so that material-ui components can be used without having to worry about passing a theme (all components implement a default theme) (#1662)
  - There's now a concept of `mui theme` and `raw theme`, `mui theme` is produced from `raw theme`
  - `ThemeManager` has been changed, no longer needs `new` in call
  - `ThemeManager` produces `mui theme` from `raw theme`. Raw themes may be user-defined.

- DatePicker - Updated to new design specs (#1266)
- LeftNav - Fix sidebar position for browsers that don't support transform3d (#1269)
- TextField - Added props to override underlineStyle when disabled (#1493)

## 0.11.0
###### _Aug 24, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- The Table component is now composable. (#1199)
  - JSON objects to create the table and the table component will no longer generate the table for you.
    The docs site provides a complete example of how a table might look: http://material-ui.com/#/components/table.
    The example also includes a 'super header' and 'super footer' row.
  - **Upgrade Path:** Instead of passing in the raw JSON data, you'll need to generate the appropriate
    TableHeader/TableRow/TableHeaderColumn components and pass them in as children. The same should be applied
    to the rowData and the footer.
- Tabs can now be controlled. In order to make this work we had to change the parameters being passed back to
  the `onChange` event to: `onChange(value, e, tab)`. Where value is the value of the tab that it was changed
  to, e is the event, and tab is the actual tab component. (#1232, #1235)
- Added a new `static` flag to the ThemeManager that defaults to `true`. If you're mutating your theme variables
  after the app initializes, set this flag to `false`. This will allow us to perform some optimizations to
  components that require theme variables. (#1397)
- ListItem (#1438, #1105)
  - Nested list items should no longer be passed in as children. Use the `nestedItems` prop instead.
  - The `open` prop has been renamed to `initiallyOpen`.
- Removed classable mixin
  - This mixin was no longer used in the library. Removing it allowed us to get rid of the `classnames`
    dependency. If you were using this mixin in your own projects, you'll need to pull the source and manually
    include it.

##### Component Fixes / Enhancements
- Buttons - Fixed a bug that caused buttons to not gain keyboard focus in some cases (#1485, #1453, #1458)
- Card
  - Properly merge `CardAction` and `CardExpandable` styles. (#1376)
  - Added Right-To-Left support to `CardExpandable`. To use this, set `isRtl` to `true` in the theme. (#1408)
- DatePicker - Fixed an error that occurred when using valueLink (#1400)
- DropDownMenu - Added `disabled` prop (#1406)
- FlatButton - Added `labelPosition` prop. (#1286)

## 0.10.0
###### _Jul 9, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Removed `input.jsx` file. This component was deprecated long ago, but was never removed from the project.
- Buttons now default to a type of `button` instead of the browser's default of `submit`. We found that
  most of the buttons in our apps were not submit buttons and it was more intuitive to default to `button`.
  If you need a submit button, be sure to pass in a type of `submit`. (#1017)
- The `DialogWindow` component was refactored into `Dialog`. `DialogWindow` was never documented and was just
  a lower level component that was used by `Dialog`. It was, however, exposed on the main `index.js` and has
  since been removed. If you were using `DialogWindow` before, you should be able to safely use
  `Dialog` instead.

##### New Components
- SvgIcons & Icon Builder
  - We've created SvgIcon versions of all the
    [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons). These SvgIcon
    components can be found in the `/lib/svg-icons` directory and were not added to the main `index.js`
    file. To use these icons, require them directly: `require('material-ui/lib/svg-icons/action/face')`.
    These icons were created using a script that crawls the icon repo and generates the
    appropriate `js` and `jsx` files and can be found in the `/icon-builder` directory.
- Menu, MenuItem, MenuDivider
  - This is a new implementation of menus and menu items. With it comes:
    - better composability
    - scrollable menus
    - better transitions
    - better keyboard access
    - selectable with value and valueLink
  - We're working on migrating some of our other components to use this new implementation. Until that's
    thats done, require these components directly if you'd like to use them:
    `require('material-ui/lib/menus/menu')`.
- IconMenu
  - This component replaces `DropDownIcon` and has all of the new menu features mentioned above.

## 0.8.0
###### _May 24, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Refactored all CSS into Javascript (#30, #316)
  - All Material-UI components now have their styles defined inline. This solves
    many problems with CSS as mentions in [@vjeux's presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)
    such as polluting the global namespace with classes that really should be
    component specific. In addition to the benefits mentioned in the
    presentation, inline styles allow Material-UI to become CSS preprocessor
    agnostic and make Themeing much more dynamic and simple.
    [Read our CSS in JS discussion](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/30)
  - Upgrade path:
    - *If you are overriding component CSS classes:* Redefine your overrides as
      an object following [React's inline styles format](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html),
      then pass it into the material-ui component via the `style` prop. These
      changes are applied to the root element of the component. If you are
      overriding a nested element of the component, check the component's
      documentation and see if there is a style prop available for that nested
      element. If a style prop does not exist for the component's nested element
      that you are trying to override, [submit an issue](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/new)
      requesting to have it added.
    - *If you are using any of Material-UI's Less files:* These files have been
      refactored into their [own javascript files](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/css-in-js/src/styles)
      and can be accessed like so `var FILENAME = require('material-ui').Styles.FILENAME;`.
      Material-UI has moved away from being a CSS Framework to being simply a
      set of React components.
- Paper component no longer generates nested divs (#601)
  - This allowed us to simplify styling of paper containers. As a result, styling the inner div is no longer necessary.

##### General
- Themes have been added (#202)
- Requiring individual components is now supported (#363)
  - An example would be: `var SvgIcon = require('material-ui/lib/svg-icon);`
  - The `/lib` folder in Material-UI contains the file structure needed when referencing individual components.

##### Components
- Date Picker
  - Added AutoOK Prop (#658)
  - Added ability to specify min and max dates (#658)
  - Added Year Selector (#658)
- Dialog now repositions on screen resize (#597)

## 0.7.0
###### _Feb. 13, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Removed Icon component - Replaced with FontIcon and SvgIcon (#318, #125, #148)
  - The main motivation here is to give developers more control over which font icons to include
    in their project. Instead of automatically including all material design icons in material-ui,
    developers can now create their own custom icon font file and just pass the icon className into
    the FontIcon component. [Read more about FontIcons](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/icons).
  - Upgrade path:
    - If you were using the Icon component before, you'll need switch to either using FontIcon or SvgIcon.
      For FontIcon, create a custom font file and include it in your project and just pass the Icon
      className into the FontIcon component. For SvgIcon, create a new React component that represents
      that particular icon. This will allow you to package your icons inside your js files. Examples
      can be found [here](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/src/js/svg-icons).
    - Additionally, all components that had an icon prop now take an iconClassName prop instead. These
      include FloatingActionButton, IconButton, Menu, MenuItem, and DropDownIcon.

##### General
- All jsx files are now being compiled before publishing to npm. (#179, #215)

##### Components
- Buttons
  - Fixed a bug that cause onClick to not fire in Safari (#307)
  - You can now pass down children into all buttons. This allows you to add icons to flat and raised buttons
    or to add a file input element. (#323, #189)
- Menu Item
  - Fixed toggle display bug (#298)
  - Toggle props can now be passed in (#299)
- Slider
  - Removed inline style @import (#218)
