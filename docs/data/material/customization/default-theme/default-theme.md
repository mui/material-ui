# Default theme viewer

<p class="description">This tree view allows you to explore how the theme object looks like with the default values.</p>

If you want to learn more about how the theme is assembled, take a look at [`material-ui/style/createTheme.ts`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/-/packages/mui-material/src/styles/createTheme.ts),
and the related imports which `createTheme()` uses.

:::info
You can explore the documentation `theme` object by opening the browser's developer console on this page. The `theme` variable is available in the console context of the documentation preview iframes.
:::

:::warning
Please note that **the documentation site is using a custom theme** (the MUI's organization branding).
