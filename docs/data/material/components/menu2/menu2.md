# Menu v2

<p class="description">Menus display a list of choices on temporary surfaces. Menu v2 adds submenus, checkbox and radio items, and grouping.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/internal-core-docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

:::warning
Menu v2 is an unstable component.
Import it from the `Unstable_Menu2` subpaths.
Its API can change in a minor release.

The [current Menu](/material-ui/react-menu/) doesn't change, and you can use both components in the same app.
:::

## Introduction

Menu v2 is a set of components that compose into a menu:

- **Menu**: the open state and behavior. It renders no element.
- **Trigger**: connects the element that opens the menu.
- **Popup**: the positioned menu surface and its transition.
- **Item**: an option for users to select.
- **Link Item**: an item that navigates.
- **Checkbox Item**, **Radio Group**, and **Radio Item**: items with a checked state.
- **Submenu**, **Submenu Trigger**, and **Submenu Popup**: the same parts for a nested menu.
- **Group**, **Group Label**, and **Separator**: the structure in a menu.

Each component is the default export of its own `@mui/material/Unstable_Menu2*` subpath.
The examples use local names such as `Menu` and `MenuItem`.
The import paths, theme keys, and CSS classes keep their `Menu2` names.

## Why a new menu component

Submenus are [one of the most requested Menu features since 2018](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/11723), but the current modal-based Menu can't support them.
Menu v2 uses [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react/components/menu) to provide more menu building blocks and improve keyboard and screen reader support:

- **Nested menus** coordinate focus and keyboard navigation. Positioning follows the anchor and flips to avoid collisions.
- **Checkbox and radio items**, labeled groups, and link items provide built-in roles and ARIA attributes.
- **Disabled items stay focusable**, and content outside the menu remains available to screen readers.
- **The trigger component** handles the anchor, ARIA attributes, and keyboard opening.

Material UI supplies the styles and theming.
Base UI is included in `@mui/material`; no extra installation is needed, and apps that don't import Menu v2 don't bundle it.

See [Upgrade to Menu v2](/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-menu-v2/) for the architecture, prop mappings, and behavior changes.

## Basic menu

Put `MenuTrigger` and `MenuPopup` inside `Menu`.
Pass the trigger element to the required `render` prop, and put the items inside `MenuPopup`.

{{"component": "file://./demos/basic/index.ts"}}

Selecting a `MenuItem` closes the menu by default.
Set `closeOnClick={false}` to keep it open.
Checkbox, radio, and link items stay open by default; set `closeOnClick` to close after selection.

:::warning
A custom trigger component must forward props and ref to its element, the same as [Tooltip](/material-ui/react-tooltip/), or the menu doesn't open.
Set `nativeButton={false}` on `MenuTrigger` when the supplied element doesn't render a native `<button>`.
:::

## Account menu

The trigger can be a composed element, such as an `IconButton` in a `Tooltip`.
`align="end"` on `MenuPopup` aligns the menu with the end of the trigger.

Give the `IconButton` a unique `id` so the menu can use it as its accessible label.
Tooltip uses its own `id` prop for the tooltip, not the button.

{{"component": "file://./demos/account/index.ts"}}

## Open a dialog

Keep the Dialog outside the menu so that it stays mounted when the menu closes.
Open it from the item's `onClick` handler.

:::warning
Dialog can save a menu item as its return target before the menu closes.
That item is then removed or hidden, so focus does not return to the trigger when Dialog closes.
:::

Keep a ref on the menu trigger and set `disableRestoreFocus` on Dialog.
Focus the trigger from `slotProps.transition.onExited` on Dialog:

```jsx
<Dialog
  open={dialogOpen}
  onClose={() => setDialogOpen(false)}
  disableRestoreFocus
  slotProps={{
    transition: {
      onExited: () => triggerRef.current?.focus({ preventScroll: true }),
    },
  }}
>
  {/* Dialog content */}
</Dialog>
```

Keep the trigger mounted and enabled until the dialog closes.
This changes the return target for Dialog, not the focus behavior of Menu v2.

## Submenu

Nest a `MenuSubmenu` in the item list.
Put `MenuSubmenuTrigger` and `MenuSubmenuPopup` inside it, with the items inside the popup.
The trigger can be wrapped in another component, but regular, link, checkbox, and radio items do not open a submenu.

{{"component": "file://./demos/submenu/index.ts"}}

By default, a submenu opens on mouse hover after 100 ms; a click does not bypass this delay.
Set `openOnHover={false}` on `MenuSubmenuTrigger` to open with a mouse click instead.
Touch taps, Enter, Space, and ArrowRight also open it, or ArrowLeft in right-to-left text.
See the [trigger API](/material-ui/api/menu-2-submenu-trigger/) for hover timing and arrow customization.
If you remove the arrow, keep another visible cue that the item opens a submenu.

Submenus nest to any depth and flip when they run out of room.
Escape closes the innermost submenu and returns focus to its trigger.
Pass `closeParentOnEsc` to `MenuSubmenu` to close the whole menu.

## Icon menu

Compose the same list primitives that you use with the current Menu: `ListItemIcon`, `ListItemText`, and `Typography` for a shortcut hint.

{{"component": "file://./demos/icon/index.ts"}}

## Dense menu

Set `slotProps.list.dense` on `MenuPopup` to make all the items compact.
Submenus inherit the parent list density and cannot override it.
An item can also set its own `dense` prop.

{{"component": "file://./demos/dense/index.ts"}}

## Checkbox and radio items

`MenuCheckboxItem` renders `role="menuitemcheckbox"` with its own indicator.
For a single choice in a set, put `MenuRadioItem` components in a `MenuRadioGroup`.
Both keep the menu open by default so users can change several options.

{{"component": "file://./demos/checkbox-radio/index.ts"}}

Read the new value from the first callback argument: `onCheckedChange(checked, eventDetails)` or `onValueChange(value, eventDetails)`.
For an uncontrolled item or group, use `defaultChecked` or `defaultValue`.
To change the icons, see [Checkbox and radio indicators](#checkbox-and-radio-indicators).

:::info
Menu v2 items do not have a `selected` prop.
Use checkbox or radio items for checked state.
:::

## Composed menu

The parts compose freely: checkbox items with shortcut hints, a submenu with a radio group, icon items, and a disabled item.

{{"component": "file://./demos/composed/index.ts"}}

## Grouped menu

`MenuGroup` and `MenuGroupLabel` label a set of related items.
The group refers to its label with `aria-labelledby`.
Use `MenuSeparator` between groups.

{{"component": "file://./demos/grouped/index.ts"}}

## Link items

`MenuLinkItem` renders a real anchor with `role="menuitem"`, so middle-click, right-click, and keyboard activation behave like a link.

{{"component": "file://./demos/link-items/index.ts"}}

A link item doesn't close the menu on click by default.
Set `closeOnClick` to close it, for example with client-side routing.

Use `render` for a router link that forwards props, ref, and children to an anchor:

```jsx
<MenuLinkItem render={<RouterLink to="/projects" />} closeOnClick>
  Projects
</MenuLinkItem>
```

The render function receives anchor props and the item state.
The [render and root-slot contracts](#render-and-root-slots) also apply; a custom root must forward props, ref, and children to an anchor.

:::warning
Unlike a classic `MenuItem` with `href`, `MenuLinkItem` does not support `disabled`.
:::

## Positioned menu

The `MenuPopup` props `side` and `align` place the menu relative to its anchor, and `sideOffset` and `alignOffset` move it.
The defaults are `side="bottom"` and `align="start"`.

Use the logical `inline-start` and `inline-end` sides to get the correct direction in right-to-left text.

Open the non-modal menu, then change the values for a live preview.
Press Escape or use the trigger to close it.

{{"component": "file://./demos/positioned/index.ts"}}

The menu flips when it collides with the edge of its container, and it follows its anchor on scroll and resize.

## Open on hover

Set `openOnHover` on `MenuTrigger` to open the menu when the pointer rests on the trigger.

{{"component": "file://./demos/hover/index.ts"}}

A menu that opens on hover isn't modal, so the rest of the page stays interactive.

## Controlled menu

Pass `open` and `onOpenChange` to `Menu` to control the open state.
The trigger still sets the ARIA attributes and receives focus when the menu closes.

{{"component": "file://./demos/controlled/index.ts"}}

### Keep the menu open

`onOpenChange` receives the reason for the change in `eventDetails.reason`.
Call `eventDetails.cancel()` to prevent a close, for example on an outside press.
This works for controlled and uncontrolled menus:

```jsx
<Menu
  onOpenChange={(open, eventDetails) => {
    if (!open && eventDetails.reason === 'outside-press') {
      eventDetails.cancel();
    }
  }}
>
  <MenuTrigger render={<Button>Options</Button>} />
  <MenuPopup>{/* Menu items */}</MenuPopup>
</Menu>
```

### Without a trigger

Omit `MenuTrigger` and pass `anchor` to `MenuPopup` to position it against an element that you control, the same as `anchorEl` in the current Menu.
The menu can't connect to that element, so you do the wiring:

- Add `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to the element. Set the matching `id` on `MenuPopup`.
- Give `MenuPopup` an accessible name with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Pass `finalFocus` to `MenuPopup` to return focus to the element when the menu closes. Otherwise, focus can move to an unrelated element.

This wiring does not provide the keyboard behavior of `MenuTrigger`.
If the external button only uses `onClick` to open the menu, Enter focuses the menu container, not the first item.
ArrowDown and ArrowUp do not open the menu.
Use `MenuTrigger` for keyboard opening and initial item focus; `finalFocus` only controls focus on close.

## Max height menu

The menu limits its height to the viewport and to the space available at the anchor, and scrolls its content.
To set a smaller limit with the `sx` prop on `MenuPopup`, use `min(320px, var(--available-height))` to keep it within short screens.

{{"component": "file://./demos/long/index.ts"}}

## Context menu

Menu v2 follows the [menu button pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/) and doesn't support context menus.
A context menu must handle right-click, the context menu key or Shift+F10, and touch long press.
It needs pointer or keyboard-based positioning, an accessible name, and focus return without a trigger button.
Building one with Menu v2 leaves these requirements to application code.

Material UI plans to add a separate context menu component.
Until then, keep using the [classic Menu context menu example](/material-ui/react-menu/#context-menu).

## Customization

Style the popup and items with `sx`, slots, or the `MuiMenu2*` theme keys.
See the [theme components](/material-ui/customization/theme-components/) guide for `defaultProps` and `styleOverrides`, and the [popup API reference](/material-ui/api/menu-2-popup/) for the slots and CSS classes.

### Slots

`Menu` and `MenuSubmenu` render no element and have no slots, DOM ref, or `sx` prop.
On `MenuPopup` and `MenuSubmenuPopup`, `ref`, `className`, `style`, `sx`, event handlers, and HTML attributes target the menu surface, which is the `root` slot.
Use `slotProps.positioner` for the positioned element and `slotProps.portal` for the stacking layer.
Set positioning props such as `side` and `align` on the popup.

The portal carries `theme.zIndex.modal` and keeps the menu and its modal interaction layer above other content, including Dialog.
Submenus stay within the root menu stacking context, so set `slotProps.portal.sx.zIndex` on `MenuPopup` to change the stacking level of the whole menu.

:::warning
A replacement `slots.portal` must provide its own stacking and closed-state styles.
With `keepMounted`, the default portal hides after the exit transition, when its positioner becomes hidden.
:::

This demo wraps `MenuPopup` in `styled()` to set defaults, style the surface directly, and style items through their class selectors:

{{"component": "file://./demos/customized/index.ts"}}

### Trigger

`MenuTrigger` merges its behavior into the element you supply through `render`.
Style that element directly, or use a scoped state selector such as `.MuiMenu2Trigger-root.Mui-open`.
Trigger props, event handlers, and the ref belong on `MenuTrigger` or the supplied element, not on `Menu`.
The `render` prop also accepts a function with props and the trigger state as arguments.
Spread those props, including the ref, onto the element returned by the function.

This example uses `open` to rotate an arrow when the menu opens.
TypeScript infers the props and state types; no separate open state is needed.
The arrow transition follows [the reduced-motion setting](/material-ui/customization/transitions/#reduced-motion).

{{"component": "file://./demos/trigger-state/index.ts"}}

:::warning
While a menu or submenu is open, Base UI renders hidden `span` elements next to its trigger for focus and accessibility.
CSS sibling selectors (`+`, `~`, `:last-child`) can match these elements.
Style each part directly instead.
The focus guards have a `data-base-ui-focus-guard` attribute.
:::

### Render and root slots

Items (including submenu triggers), groups, labels, and separators support two levels of replacement:

- **`render`** changes the root element or composes another component while keeping Material styles, theme overrides, and `sx` processing. Items also keep their ripple.
- **`slots.root`** replaces the entire styled root and takes precedence over `render`. It receives utility classes and Base UI behavior props, but no automatic Material styles, theme styles, ripple, or `sx` processing. Add these features in the replacement if needed.

In both cases, forward the supplied props, ref, and children to the root element to preserve behavior and accessibility.
Put item content in the item children.
With `render`, forward `props.children` to keep the ripple and any indicator; children set on the render element can replace them.
A root-slot replacement also receives the item content and indicator as children.

Use `slotProps.root` for root attributes, a ref, and `sx`.
Its callback receives the same public state as the render function.
The sections below describe the state and visual options for each part.

### Item

`MenuItem` renders a styled `<div>` by default.
A render function receives props and the `highlighted`, `disabled`, `dense`, `disableGutters`, and `divider` states.
For example, wrap the root element in a Tooltip:

```jsx
<MenuItem
  render={(props) => (
    <Tooltip title="Create a file" describeChild>
      <div {...props} />
    </Tooltip>
  )}
>
  File
</MenuItem>
```

An element such as `render={<button />}` or `slots={{ root: 'button' }}` sets `nativeButton` automatically.
For a custom component or render function that returns a native button, set `nativeButton` explicitly.

Use the root-slot callback to style an item by state:

```jsx
<MenuItem
  slotProps={{
    root: ({ highlighted }) => ({
      sx: { fontWeight: highlighted ? 700 : 400 },
    }),
  }}
>
  File
</MenuItem>
```

Checkbox and radio items also expose `checked`; submenu triggers expose `open`.
The `open` state becomes false when closing starts, even while the exit animation runs.
Use `slots.indicator` and `slotProps.indicator` to customize the indicator separately.

### Groups

`MenuGroup` and `MenuRadioGroup` render a `<div>` by default.
The `MenuGroup` state has no fields.
The `MenuRadioGroup` state contains only `disabled`, not the selected value; use `value` and `onValueChange` to control that value.

### Labels and separators

`MenuGroupLabel` uses a non-sticky `ListSubheader` rendered as a `<div>` by default.
Set `color`, `disableGutters`, and `inset` on `MenuGroupLabel` to use the corresponding ListSubheader styles.
Use `sx` for style overrides and `render` to change the element:

```jsx
<MenuGroupLabel color="primary" inset sx={{ fontWeight: 700 }} render={<p />}>
  Projects
</MenuGroupLabel>
```

The default label stays non-sticky; there is no `disableSticky` prop.

`MenuSeparator` uses a `Divider` rendered as a `<div>`, with menu spacing.
Set `absolute`, `flexItem`, `textAlign`, and `variant` on `MenuSeparator` to use the corresponding Divider styles.
Use `sx` for custom spacing:

```jsx
<MenuSeparator variant="inset" sx={{ my: 1.5 }} />
```

For both parts, the top-level visual props apply to the default styled root, including when you use `render`.
With `slots.root`, provide appearance in the replacement component.
The `orientation` prop still controls separator semantics.

The label state has no fields.
The separator state contains `orientation`, which is `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"`.

### Shared theme styles

`MuiMenu2Popup.styleOverrides` also applies to matching submenu popup slots.
`MuiMenu2Item.styleOverrides` applies to the default styled item roots, including link, checkbox, and radio items and submenu triggers.
The `dense`, `divider`, and `gutters` overrides apply when the corresponding state matches.
Theme variants are shared too; menu variants apply only to the `root` slot.

Component-specific styles apply after shared styles, with `sx` last; CSS specificity still applies.
Callbacks receive the live state of the rendered component.
Utility classes remain component-specific, and **`defaultProps` are not shared** between theme keys.

Use scoped state selectors such as `.MuiMenu2CheckboxItem-root.Mui-checked` inside a slot override, or a theme variant for states such as `highlighted`.

### State data attributes

Menu v2 also provides these Base UI `data-*` attributes for CSS selectors and Tailwind CSS:

| Element                                                     | Attributes                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Root menu trigger                                           | `data-popup-open`, `data-pressed`, `data-disabled`                                                |
| `MenuItem` root                                             | `data-highlighted`, `data-disabled`                                                               |
| `MenuLinkItem` root                                         | `data-highlighted`                                                                                |
| `MenuCheckboxItem` and `MenuRadioItem` roots and indicators | `data-highlighted`, `data-disabled`, `data-checked`, `data-unchecked`                             |
| `MenuSubmenuTrigger` root                                   | `data-popup-open`, `data-highlighted`, `data-disabled`                                            |
| Popup `root` slot                                           | `data-open`, `data-closed`, `data-side`, `data-align`, `data-starting-style`, `data-ending-style` |
| `positioner` slot                                           | `data-open`, `data-closed`, `data-side`, `data-align`                                             |
| Optional `backdrop` slot                                    | `data-open`, `data-closed`, `data-starting-style`, `data-ending-style`                            |

State attributes have an empty value when active and are absent otherwise: use `[data-checked]`, not `[data-checked="true"]`.
Checked items and their indicators have either `data-checked` or `data-unchecked`.
`data-side` and `data-align` contain the resolved placement after collision handling.

Triggers use `data-popup-open`, not `data-open`.
On the root trigger, `data-pressed` follows the open state.
`data-disabled` is present when you set `disabled` on `Menu` or on `MenuTrigger`.
`data-highlighted` follows pointer and keyboard navigation, including focus on disabled items; use `.Mui-focusVisible` for keyboard focus-visible styles.

The `portal` and `list` slots and the submenu arrow have no automatic state attributes.
Custom slots must forward the supplied props and ref.
Internal `data-mui-*` markers are not part of this styling contract.

For example, after the [Tailwind CSS v4 setup](/material-ui/integrations/tailwindcss/tailwindcss-v4/), style a checked item with a presence variant:

```jsx
<MenuCheckboxItem className="data-[checked]:font-semibold">
  Show toolbar
</MenuCheckboxItem>
```

### Checkbox and radio indicators

Use `slots.indicatorIcon` on `MenuCheckboxItem` and `MenuRadioItem` to replace the icon.
The custom component receives the live state in `ownerState`.
Use `ownerState.checked` to select the icon, then forward the other props and ref without `ownerState`.

{{"component": "file://./demos/indicator-icons/index.ts"}}

Use `slotProps.indicator` to customize the indicator container, or `slots.indicator` to replace it.
If `slotProps.indicator.children` is neither `null` nor `undefined`, it replaces the generated icon.
Slot callbacks receive the live checked, disabled, and highlighted state.
A replacement must forward the supplied props and ref, including the state classes in `className`.

Use `slotProps.indicatorIcon` to style the icon or set its size.
The default checkbox icon accepts `SvgIcon` props and has an SVG ref.
The default radio icon is a `span` with two SVGs; it accepts `fontSize="small"` or `"medium"`, `sx`, and span props and refs.
Both default to `fontSize="small"`.

The default indicators use `ListItemIcon`, so its selectors also affect indicators.
With modular CSS layers, `MuiListItemIcon` theme overrides take precedence over default indicator colors.
Use `MuiMenu2CheckboxItem.styleOverrides.indicator` or `MuiMenu2RadioItem.styleOverrides.indicator` for the container, and `styleOverrides.indicatorIcon` for the icon.
Neither slot has a separate theme key.
The internal indicator components are not exported, but their owning items export `menu2CheckboxItemIndicatorClasses` and `menu2RadioItemIndicatorClasses` for CSS selectors.
The icon uses `menu2CheckboxItemClasses.indicatorIcon` or `menu2RadioItemClasses.indicatorIcon`.

### Transitions

`MenuPopup` uses the `Grow` transition, the same as the current Menu.
With the default `transitionDuration="auto"`, the duration depends on the height of the menu.
Pass a different transition component to `slots.transition` on the popup, and its props to `slotProps.transition`:

{{"component": "file://./demos/fade/index.ts"}}

Grow, Fade, and Zoom work with Menu v2.
A custom transition must forward the props and ref of its child, animate that same popup element, and add no DOM wrapper.
The animation must start in time for Base UI to detect it.
Test other transitions before use.

The adapter controls `in`, `appear`, `mountOnEnter`, and `unmountOnExit`.

:::warning
Use `onOpenChangeComplete(open)` on `Menu` for completion, not `onEntered` or `onExited` on the transition.
Base UI controls mounting and can unmount the transition before its completion timer fires.
:::

Set `transitionDuration={0}` to remove the animation.
To animate with CSS, set `slots.transition` to `null`.
The menu surface has `data-starting-style` for its initial style, then removes it to start the enter transition.
It has `data-ending-style` while it leaves:

```jsx
<MenuPopup
  slots={{ transition: null }}
  slotProps={{
    root: {
      sx: {
        transition: 'opacity 150ms',
        '&[data-starting-style], &[data-ending-style]': { opacity: 0 },
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* Menu items */}
</MenuPopup>
```

`Grow` and the other Material UI transitions follow [`theme.motion.reducedMotion`](/material-ui/customization/transitions/#reduced-motion).
CSS animations need their own reduced-motion handling.

`data-closed` marks the logical closed state, not the end of the exit transition.
With `keepMounted` on `MenuPopup`, the menu surface and the positioner keep `data-closed` while they are hidden after the transition.
Without it, they unmount.

### Backdrop

A modal menu renders a transparent backdrop inside the portal, behind the menu.
The backdrop blocks clicks outside the menu, so the first outside click only closes the menu.
It is absent when a menu opens on hover or has `modal={false}`.

Set `slots.backdrop` or `slotProps.backdrop` on `MenuPopup` to customize it.
For a non-modal menu, these props render the backdrop, and it does not capture pointer events.
To dim the page:

```jsx
<MenuPopup slotProps={{ backdrop: { sx: { bgcolor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)' } } }}>
  {/* Menu items */}
</MenuPopup>
```

Set `slots={{ backdrop: null }}` to omit the backdrop, including when the theme supplies backdrop slot props.
Outside clicks then reach the page and close the menu, and the page scroll stays locked.
Submenus have no backdrop slot.

## Accessibility

Menu v2 follows the [WAI-ARIA menu button pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/).
It handles the trigger, the roles, the keyboard behavior, focus management, and dismissal:

- The trigger gets `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`.
- Opening with a pointer highlights no item. Enter, Space, and ArrowDown highlight the first enabled item; ArrowUp highlights the last enabled item.
- Arrow keys move between items and respect right-to-left text. Home and End move to the first and the last item.
- Typeahead matches items by their text content, or by the `label` prop when the content isn't plain text.
- Disabled items stay focusable, and screen readers announce them as disabled.
- Escape closes one level at a time and returns focus to the trigger of that level.

The menu takes its accessible name from the trigger.
`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on `MenuPopup` replaces it, and an explicit `aria-labelledby` takes precedence over `aria-label`.
Matching attributes on `slotProps.root` take precedence over the top-level ones.

Two things stay your responsibility:

- **Label an icon-only trigger.** Pass `aria-label` to `MenuTrigger` or the supplied element.
- **Keep custom item content readable.** Icons, secondary text, and shortcut hints in an item need sufficient contrast.
