# Popper

<p class="description">A Popper can be used to display some content on top of another. It's an alternative to react-popper.</p>

Some important features of the Popper component:

- ðŸ•· Popper relies on the 3rd party library ([Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/)) for perfect positioning.
- ðŸ’„ It's an alternative API to react-popper. It aims for simplicity.
- Its child element is a [MUIÂ Base Portal](https://v6.mui.com/base-ui/react-portal/) on the body of the document to avoid rendering problems.
  You can disable this behavior with `disablePortal`.
- The scroll isn't blocked like with the [Popover](/material-ui/react-popover/) component.
  The placement of the popper updates with the available area in the viewport.
- Clicking away does not hide the Popper component.
  If you need this behavior, you can use the [MUIÂ Base Click-Away Listener](https://v6.mui.com/base-ui/react-click-away-listener/) - see the example in the [menu documentation section](/material-ui/react-menu/#composition-with-menu-list).
- The `anchorEl` is passed as the reference object to create a new `Popper.js` instance.

## Basic Popper

{{"demo": "SimplePopper.js"}}

## Transitions

The open/close state of the popper can be animated with a render prop child and a transition component.
This component should respect the following conditions:

- Be a direct child descendent of the popper.
- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.
- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.
  These two callbacks allow the popper to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.

Popper has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).

Alternatively, you can use [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring).

## Positioned popper

## Scroll playground

## Virtual element

The value of the `anchorEl` prop can be a reference to a fake DOM element.
You need to create an object shaped like the [`VirtualElement`](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/virtual-elements/).
