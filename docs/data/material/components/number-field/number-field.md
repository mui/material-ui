# Number Field

<p class="description">A Number Field is designed to receive numeric input from the user.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Introduction

The Number Field component combines the powerful functionality of [Base UI — Number Field](https://base-ui.com/react/components/number-field) with building blocks from Material UI for visual representation.

<!-- #npm-tag-reference -->

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install @base-ui-components/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @base-ui-components/react
```

```bash yarn
