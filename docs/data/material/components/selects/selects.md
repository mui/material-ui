# Select

<p class="description">Select components are used for collecting user provided information from a list of options.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Basic select

Menus are positioned under their emitting elements, unless they are close to the bottom of the viewport.

{{"demo": "BasicSelect.js"}}

## Advanced features

The Select component is meant to be interchangeable with a native `<select>` element.

If you are looking for more advanced features, like combobox, multiselect, autocomplete, async or creatable support, head to the [`Autocomplete` component](/material-ui/react-autocomplete/).
It's meant to be an improved version of the "react-select" and "downshift" packages.

## Props

The Select component is implemented as a custom `<input>` element of the [InputBase](/material-ui/api/input-base/).
It extends the [text field components](/material-ui/react-text-field/) subcomponents, either the [OutlinedInput](/material-ui/api/outlined-input/), [Input](/material-ui/api/input/), or [FilledInput](/material-ui/api/filled-input/), depending on the variant selected.
It shares the same styles and many of the same props. Refer to the respective component's API page for details.

:::warning
Unlike input components, the `placeholder` prop is not available in Select. To add a placeholder, refer to the [placeholder](#placeholder) section below.
:::

### Filled and standard variants

{{"demo": "SelectVariants.js"}}

### Labels and helper text

{{"demo": "SelectLabels.js"}}

:::warning
Note that when using FormControl with the outlined variant of the Select, you need to provide a label in two places: in the InputLabel component and in the `label` prop of the Select component (see the above demo).
:::

### Auto width

{{"demo": "SelectAutoWidth.js"}}

### Small Size

{{"demo": "SelectSmall.js"}}

### Other props

{{"demo": "SelectOtherProps.js"}}

## Native select

As the user experience can be improved on mobile using the native select of the platform,
we allow such pattern.

{{"demo": "NativeSelectDemo.js"}}

## TextField

The `TextField` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input and help text.
You can find an example with the select mode [in this section](/material-ui/react-text-field/#select).

## Customization

Here are some examples of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/).

The first step is to style the `InputBase` component.
Once it's styled, you can either use it directly as a text field or provide it to the select `input` prop to have a `select` field.
Notice that the `"standard"` variant is easier to customize, since it does not wrap the contents in a `fieldset`/`legend` markup.

{{"demo": "CustomizedSelects.js"}}

ðŸŽ¨ If you are looking for inspiration, you can check [MUI Treasury's customization examples](https://mui-treasury.com/?path=/docs/select-introduction--docs).

## Multiple select

The `Select` component can handle multiple selections.
It's enabled with the `multiple` prop.

Like with the single selection, you can pull out the new value by accessing `event.target.value` in the `onChange` callback. It's always an array.

### Default

{{"demo": "MultipleSelect.js"}}

### Checkmarks

{{"demo": "MultipleSelectCheckmarks.js"}}

### Chip

{{"demo": "MultipleSelectChip.js"}}

### Placeholder

{{"demo": "MultipleSelectPlaceholder.js"}}

### Native

{{"demo": "MultipleSelectNative.js"}}

## Controlling the open state

You can control the open state of the select with the `open` prop. Alternatively, it is also possible to set the initial (uncontrolled) open state of the component with the `defaultOpen` prop.

:::info

- A component is **controlled** when it's managed by its parent using props.
- A component is **uncontrolled** when it's managed by its own local state.

Learn more about controlled and uncontrolled components in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components).
:::

{{"demo": "ControlledOpenSelect.js"}}

## With a dialog

While it's discouraged by the Material Design guidelines, you can use a select inside a dialog.

{{"demo": "DialogSelect.js"}}

## Grouping

Display categories with the `ListSubheader` component or the native `<optgroup>` element.

{{"demo": "GroupedSelect.js"}}

:::warning
If you wish to wrap the ListSubheader in a custom component, you'll have to annotate it so MaterialÂ UI can handle it properly when determining focusable elements.

You have two options for solving this:
Option 1: Define a static boolean field called `muiSkipListHighlight` on your component function, and set it to `true`:

```tsx
function MyListSubheader(props: ListSubheaderProps) {
  return <ListSubheader {...props} />;
}

MyListSubheader.muiSkipListHighlight = true;
export default MyListSubheader;

// elsewhere:

return (
  <Select>
    <MyListSubheader>Group 1</MyListSubheader>
    <MenuItem value={1}>Option 1</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={2}>Option 2</MenuItem>
    <MyListSubheader>Group 2</MyListSubheader>
    <MenuItem value={3}>Option 3</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={4}>Option 4</MenuItem>
    {/* ... */}
  </Select>
```

Option 2: Place a `muiSkipListHighlight` prop on each instance of your component.
The prop doesn't have to be forwarded to the ListSubheader, nor present in the underlying DOM element.
It just has to be placed on a component that's used as a subheader.

```tsx
export default function MyListSubheader(
  props: ListSubheaderProps & { muiSkipListHighlight: boolean },
) {
  const { muiSkipListHighlight, ...other } = props;
  return <ListSubheader {...other} />;
}

// elsewhere:

return (
  <Select>
    <MyListSubheader muiSkipListHighlight>Group 1</MyListSubheader>
    <MenuItem value={1}>Option 1</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={2}>Option 2</MenuItem>
    <MyListSubheader muiSkipListHighlight>Group 2</MyListSubheader>
    <MenuItem value={3}>Option 3</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={4}>Option 4</MenuItem>
    {/* ... */}
  </Select>
);
```

We recommend the first option as it doesn't require updating all the usage sites of the component.

Keep in mind this is **only necessary** if you wrap the ListSubheader in a custom component.
If you use the ListSubheader directly, **no additional code is required**.

## Accessibility

To properly label your `Select` input you need an extra element with an `id` that contains a label.
That `id` needs to match the `labelId` of the `Select`, for example:

```jsx
<InputLabel id="label">Age</InputLabel>
<Select labelId="label" id="select" value="20">
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</Select>
```

Alternatively a `TextField` with an `id` and `label` creates the proper markup and
ids for you:

```jsx
<TextField id="select" label="Age" value="20" select>
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</TextField>
```

For a [native select](#native-select), you should mention a label by giving the value of the `id` attribute of the select element to the `InputLabel`'s `htmlFor` attribute:

```jsx
<InputLabel htmlFor="select">Age</InputLabel>
<NativeSelect id="select">
  <option value="10">Ten</option>
  <option value="20">Twenty</option>
</NativeSelect>
```
