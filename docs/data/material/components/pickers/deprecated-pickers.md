# Date / Time pickers

<p class="description">The `<DatePicker>`, `<TimePicker>`, and related components have been moved to MUI X—our collection of advanced components.</p>

## Why have the picker components been moved to MUI X?

MUI X components are those meant to support complex use cases. Pickers can seem trivial but they're considerably tricky to pull off correctly, so we've moved them over to the X collection to make sure we're investing proper time and effort. If you want to know more details, check out the [blog post](/blog/lab-pickers-to-mui-x/).

## How to migrate?

Follow the [migration page](/x/react-date-pickers/migration/) to migrate from lab to MUI X.

## Where is the new documentation?

You can find Date / Time pickers' documentation in the [MUI X docs](/x/react-date-pickers/).

## How to report issues, request a feature, or submit a PR?

You should go to the [MUI X repository](https://github.com/mui/mui-x) to do those things now that the Pickers have been moved there.
