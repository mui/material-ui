# Dialog

<p class="description">Dialogs inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.</p>

A Dialog is a type of [modal](/material-ui/react-modal/) window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Introduction

Dialogs are implemented using a collection of related components:

- Dialog: the parent component that renders the modal.
- Dialog Title: a wrapper used for the title of a Dialog.
- Dialog Actions: an optional container for a Dialog's Buttons.
- Dialog Content: an optional container for displaying the Dialog's content.
- Dialog Content Text: a wrapper for text inside of `<DialogContent />`.
- Slide: optional [Transition](/material-ui/transitions/#slide) used to slide the Dialog in from the edge of the screen.

{{"demo": "SimpleDialogDemo.js"}}

## Basics

```jsx
import Dialog from '@mui/material/Dialog';
import DialogTitle from '@mui/material/DialogTitle';
```

## Alerts

Alerts are urgent interruptions, requiring acknowledgement, that inform the user about a situation.

Most alerts don't need titles.
They summarize a decision in a sentence or two by either:

- Asking a question (for example "Delete this conversation?")
- Making a statement related to the action buttons

Use title bar alerts only for high-risk situations, such as the potential loss of connectivity.
Users should be able to understand the choices based on the title and button text alone.

If a title is required:

- Use a clear question or statement with an explanation in the content area, such as "Erase USB storage?".
- Avoid apologies, ambiguity, or questions, such as "Warning!" or "Are you sure?"

## Transitions

You can also swap out the transition, the next example uses `Slide`.

{{"demo": "AlertDialogSlide.js"}}

## Form dialogs

Form dialogs allow users to fill out form fields within a dialog.
For example, if your site prompts for potential subscribers to fill in their email address, they can fill out the email field and touch 'Submit'.

{{"demo": "FormDialog.js"}}

## Customization

Here is an example of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/).

The dialog has a close button added to aid usability.

{{"demo": "CustomizedDialogs.js"}}

## Full-screen dialogs

{{"demo": "FullScreenDialog.js"}}

## Optional sizes

You can set a dialog maximum width by using the `maxWidth` enumerable in combination with the `fullWidth` boolean.
When the `fullWidth` prop is true, the dialog will adapt based on the `maxWidth` value.

{{"demo": "MaxWidthDialog.js"}}

## Responsive full-screen

You may make a dialog responsively full screen using [`useMediaQuery`](/material-ui/react-use-media-query/).

```jsx
import useMediaQuery from '@mui/material/useMediaQuery';

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const fullScreen = useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down('md'));

  return <Dialog fullScreen={fullScreen} />;
}
```

{{"demo": "ResponsiveDialog.js"}}

## Confirmation dialogs

Confirmation dialogs require users to explicitly confirm their choice before an option is committed.
For example, users can listen to multiple ringtones but only make a final selection upon touching "OK".

Touching "Cancel" in a confirmation dialog, cancels the action, discards any changes, and closes the dialog.

{{"demo": "ConfirmationDialog.js"}}

## Non-modal dialog

Dialogs can also be non-modal, meaning they don't interrupt user interaction behind it.
Visit [the Nielsen Norman Group article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/) for more in-depth guidance about modal vs. non-modal dialog usage.

The demo below shows a persistent cookie banner, a common non-modal dialog use case.

{{"demo": "CookiesBanner.js", "iframe": true}}

## Draggable dialog

You can create a draggable dialog by using [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable).
To do so, you can pass the imported `Draggable` component as the `PaperComponent` of the `Dialog` component.
This will make the entire dialog draggable.

{{"demo": "DraggableDialog.js"}}

## Scrolling long content

When dialogs become too long for the user's viewport or device, they scroll.

- `scroll=paper` the content of the dialog scrolls within the paper element.
- `scroll=body` the content of the dialog scrolls within the body element.

Try the demo below to see what we mean:

{{"demo": "ScrollDialog.js"}}
