:::warning
Please refer to the [Textarea Autosize](/base-ui/react-textarea-autosize/) component page in the Base UI docs for demos and details on usage.

Textarea Autosize is a part of the standalone [Base UI](/base-ui/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.
