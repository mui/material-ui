Please refer to the [Textarea Autosize](/base-ui/react-textarea-autosize/) component page in the MUI Base docs for demos and details on usage.

It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version after MUI Base gets a stable release.
