# Breadcrumbs

<p class="description">A breadcrumbs is a list of links that help visualize a page's location within a site's hierarchical structure, it allows navigation up to any of the ancestors.</p>

## Condensed with menu

As an alternative, consider adding a Menu component to display the condensed links in a dropdown list:

{{"demo": "CondensedWithMenu.js"}}

You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/).

## Integration with react-router

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/)

Be sure to add a `aria-label` description on the `Breadcrumbs` component.

The accessibility of this component relies on:

- The set of links is structured using an ordered list (`<ol>` element).
- To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are hidden with `aria-hidden`.
- A nav element labeled with `aria-label` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
