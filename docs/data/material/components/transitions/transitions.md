# Transitions

<p class="description">Transitions help to make a UI expressive and easy to use.</p>

Material UI provides transitions that can be used to introduce some basic [motion](https://m2.material.io/design/motion/) to your applications.

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader", "design": false}}

## Collapse

Expand from the start edge of the child element.
Use the `orientation` prop if you need a horizontal collapse.
The `collapsedSize` prop can be used to set the minimum width/height when not expanded.

{{"demo": "SimpleCollapse.js", "bg": true}}

## Fade

Fade in from transparent to opaque.

{{"demo": "SimpleFade.js", "bg": true}}

## Grow

Expands outwards from the center of the child element, while also fading in from transparent to opaque.

The second example demonstrates how to change the `transform-origin`, and conditionally applies
the `timeout` prop to change the entry speed.

{{"demo": "SimpleGrow.js", "bg": true}}

## Slide

Slide in from the edge of the screen.
The `direction` prop controls which edge of the screen the transition starts from.

The Transition component's `mountOnEnter` prop prevents the child component from being mounted
until `in` is `true`.
This prevents the relatively positioned component from scrolling into view
from its off-screen position.
Similarly, the `unmountOnExit` prop removes the component from the DOM after it has been transition off-screen.

{{"demo": "SimpleSlide.js", "bg": true}}

### Slide relative to a container

The Slide component also accepts `container` prop, which is a reference to a DOM node.
If this prop is set, the Slide component will slide from the edge of that DOM node.

{{"demo": "SlideFromContainer.js", "bg": true}}

## Zoom

Expand outwards from the center of the child element.

This example also demonstrates how to delay the enter transition.

{{"demo": "SimpleZoom.js", "bg": true}}

## Child requirement

- **Forward the style**: To better support server rendering, Material UI provides a `style` prop to the children of some transition components (Fade, Grow, Zoom, Slide).
  The `style` prop must be applied to the DOM for the animation to work as expected.
- **Forward the ref**: The transition components require the first child element to forward its ref to the DOM node. For more details about ref, check out [Caveat with refs](/material-ui/guides/composition/#caveat-with-refs)
- **Single element**: The transition components require only one child element (`React.Fragment` is not allowed).

```jsx
// The `props` object contains a `style` prop.
// You need to provide it to the `div` element as shown here.
const MyComponent = React.forwardRef(function (props, ref) {
  return (
    <div ref={ref} {...props}>
      Fade
    </div>
  );
});

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <Fade>
      {/* MyComponent must be the only child */}
      <MyComponent />
    </Fade>
  );
}
```

## TransitionGroup

To animate a component when it is mounted or unmounted, you can use the [`TransitionGroup`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition-group/) component from _react-transition-group_.
As components are added or removed, the `in` prop is toggled automatically by `TransitionGroup`.

{{"demo": "TransitionGroupExample.js"}}

## TransitionComponent prop

Some Material UI components use these transitions internally. These accept a `TransitionComponent` prop to customize the default transition.
You can use any of the above components or your own.
It should respect the following conditions:

- Accepts an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open/close state.
- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.
- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.
  These two callbacks allow to unmount the children when in a closed state and fully transitioned.

For more information on creating a custom transition, visit the _react-transition-group_ [`Transition` documentation](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition/).
You can also visit the dedicated sections of some of the components:

- [Modal](/material-ui/react-modal/#transitions)
- [Dialog](/material-ui/react-dialog/#transitions)
- [Popper](/material-ui/react-popper/#transitions)
- [Snackbar](/material-ui/react-snackbar/#transitions)
- [Tooltip](/material-ui/react-tooltip/#transitions)

## Performance & SEO

The content of transition component is mounted by default even if `in={false}`.
This default behavior has server-side rendering and SEO in mind.
If you render expensive component trees inside your transition it might be a good idea to change this default behavior by enabling the
`unmountOnExit` prop:

```jsx
<Fade in={false} unmountOnExit />
```

As with any performance optimization this is not a silver bullet.
Be sure to identify bottlenecks first and then try out these optimization strategies.
