# Backdrop

<p class="description">The Backdrop component narrows the user's focus to a particular element on the screen.</p>

The Backdrop signals a state change within the application and can be used for creating loaders, dialogs, and more.
In its simplest form, the Backdrop component will add a dimmed layer over your application.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Example

The demo below shows a basic Backdrop with a Circular Progress component in the foreground to indicate a loading state.
After clicking **Show Backdrop**, you can click anywhere on the page to close it.

{{"demo": "SimpleBackdrop.js"}}
