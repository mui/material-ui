# CRUD Dashboard Template

This template provides a ready-made CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) dashboard built using Material UI v7 components, layout primitives, and theming.

## 📦 Required Dependencies

Before using the template, ensure your project has the following installed:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @mui/lab @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-router-dom
```

> You may also need `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` if your project uses TypeScript.


## 📁 Required Folders

The CRUD dashboard template uses multiple shared components and layout files.

To avoid **missing import errors**, make sure to copy the **entire template folder**, including:

- `/components`
- `/layouts`
- `/theme`

Copying only the main page file will result in missing component or missing import errors.
