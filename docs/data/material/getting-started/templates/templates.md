# React Templates

<p class="description">A selection of free react templates to help you get started building your app. The collection contains react dashboard, react admin, and more.</p>

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

The templates can be combined with one of the [example projects](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files,
making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example)
for reuse in other pages.
For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes
the purpose of each file.

{{"demo": "Templates.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": true}}

If while using these examples you make changes or enhancements that could improve the
developer experience, or you would like to contribute an additional example,
please consider creating a [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pulls).

So far we have demos for a dashboard, sign in page, sign up page, blog page, checkout flow, album page, pricing page, and sticky footer page.
