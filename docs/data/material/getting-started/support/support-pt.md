## Ajuda da comunidade (grátis)

A comunidade é sua primeira parada para perguntas e conselhos sobre o framework. Bem-vindo à comunidade!

### StackOverflow

For crowdsourced answers from expert MUI developers in our community. StackOverflow is also visited from time to time by the maintainers of MUI.

[Poste uma pergunta](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mui)

> 💡 **Tip**: If you're using an older version and use external resources (such as StackOverflow) for help with it, you may find answers with links that direct you to content that no longer exists in the latest version of the documentation. To easily access any previous version of the docs, simply add `v[number]` at the beginning of the URL, like so: [v4.mui.com](https://v4.mui.com/).

### GitHub

Usamos issues do GitHub exclusivamente para rastrear bugs e solicitações de recursos. Se você acha que encontrou um bug ou tem uma nova idéia de recurso, comece certificando-se de que ele ainda não foi [relatado ou corrigido](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed). Você pode pesquisar nas issues existentes e pull requests para ver se alguém relatou algo semelhante ao seu.

#### Novas diretrizes para issues

- Por favor, siga o modelo de issue.
- Comece o título com '[ComponentName]', quando apropriado, e use uma descrição sucinta que ajude outras pessoas a encontrar issues semelhantes.
  - "doesn't work" ❌
  - "[Button] Add support for <some feature>" ✅
- Não agrupe vários tópicos em uma issue - cada um deve ter sua própria issue.
- Por favor, não comente "+1" em uma issue. Isso engana os mantenedores e não ajuda a avançar com a issue. Use as reações do GitHub (👍).

## Suporte profissional (premium)

### Pro/Premium plans

MUI comes in [three plans](/pricing/). The support available on the Community plan is mostly made possible thanks to people like you: the community. It's described in more detail in the above section. The maintainers of MUI focuses on solving the root issues, not direct support.

The Pro plan allows developers to license extra features that are challenging to find in the OSS space. The maintainers of MUI provide support for these paid features. They aim for a similar quality of experience to the one provided by the community on the open-source modules however no SLAs are provided.

The Premium plan goes one step further by providing SLAs on the quality of the support.

### Tidelift subscription

MUI and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open-source you use.

If you want the flexibility of open-source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is worth looking at.

The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you:

- Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open-source software that your application depends on.
- Your subscription helps pay the open-source community maintainers of the packages you use, to ensure they meet the standards you require.
- Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert participating open-source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
- Tidelift helps measure and improve your open-source dependencies' health – which improves your app's health – and gives a shortlist of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
- Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open-source packages, such as intellectual property indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications – and your business.

### Trabalho customizado 🛠

Tweak MUI to meet specific requirements. Give us a summary of your needs and we'll help you if we can. We might:

- Give you an estimate of time and price if the work is straightforward
- Suggest alternatives that might not require MUI
- Decline the work due to timing or relevancy

Note that work must be MUI related. We don't accept general React development work. Our contracting price is $200/hour or $1,500/day.
