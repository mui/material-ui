### GitHub

我们用 GitHub issues 作为唯一的记录 BUG 或特性需求的跟踪方式。 如果你认为发现了一个 bug，或有一个新功能的想法，在您提交之前，请先确保它没有被 [报告过或解决过](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed)。 您可以搜索已有的 Issues 或者 Pull Requests，这样可以知晓是否有人已报告过类似的问题。

- [开一个 issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/new/choose)
- [Open an issue on MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose)

#### 新 Issue 指南

- 请遵循 issue 模板。
- 请适当的以 '[ComponentName]' 为标题开始，并加以简洁的描述，这样能够帮助其他人找到类似的问题。
  - 使用"不工作"为标题 ❌
  - "[Button] 增加对 ... 的支持 <some feature>" ✅
- 请不要在一个 issue 中涵盖多个——取而代之的，是每一个话题有其独自的 issue。
- 请不要在一个 issue 评论中回复“+1”。 这样其实是向维护者发送垃圾信息，而中也无法帮助问题取得进展。 您可以用 GitHub 的表情（👍）来替代。

## 专业支持（高级）

### Tidelift 订阅

MUI comes in [three plans](/pricing/). The support available on the Community plan is mostly made possible thanks to people like you: the community. It's described in more detail in the above section. The maintainers of MUI focuses on solving the root issues, not direct support.

The Pro plan allows developers to license extra features that are challenging to find in the OSS space. The maintainers of MUI provide support for these paid features. They aim for a similar quality of experience to the one provided by the community on the open-source modules however no SLAs are provided.

The Premium plan goes one step further by providing SLAs on the quality of the support.

### Tidelift subscription

MUI and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open-source you use.

If you want the flexibility of open-source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is worth looking at.

The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you:

- Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open-source software that your application depends on.
- Your subscription helps pay the open-source community maintainers of the packages you use, to ensure they meet the standards you require.
- Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert participating open-source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
- Tidelift helps measure and improve your open-source dependencies' health – which improves your app's health – and gives a shortlist of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
- Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open-source packages, such as intellectual property indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications – and your business.

### 定制的工作 🛠

Tweak MUI to meet specific requirements. Give us a summary of your needs and we'll help you if we can. We might:

- Give you an estimate of time and price if the work is straightforward
- Suggest alternatives that might not require MUI
- Decline the work due to timing or relevancy

Note that work must be MUI related. We don't accept general React development work. Our contracting price is $200/hour or $1,500/day.
