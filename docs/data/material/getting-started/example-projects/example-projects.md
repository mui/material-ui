# Example projects

<p class="description">A collection of example, boilerplates, and scaffolds to jumpstart your next Material UI project.</p>

## Official examples

The following starter projects are all available in the MUI Core [`/examples`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples) folder.
These examples feature Material UI paired with other popular React libraries and frameworks, so you can skip the initial setup steps and jump straight into building.

Not sure which to pick?
We recommend Next.js for a comprehensive solution, or Vite if you're looking for a leaner development experience.
See [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) from the official React docs to learn more about the options available.
