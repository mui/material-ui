# Accessibility conformance report

<p class="description">How Material UI components conform to WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA, reported in VPAT terms for procurement and accessibility review.</p>

:::warning
**Draft — partial coverage.** This report covers the 12 components assessed so far, not the whole library. It has not been reviewed by an external auditor, and no assistive-technology testing has been performed yet. See [Scope and limitations](#scope-and-limitations) before relying on it for a procurement decision.

## About this report

This is a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) style report: it states how far Material UI meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) at Levels A and AA, using the conformance vocabulary defined by the [Information Technology Industry Council](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat).

Each component is rated criterion by criterion in its own report, kept next to the source code at `packages/mui-material/src/<Component>/accessibility.md`. Those reports carry the reasoning, the responsibility split, and reproducible manual test steps for every criterion. **The table below summarizes them; follow a component link for the detail.**

## Conformance by component

Each row counts only the criteria that **apply** to that component; criteria that are Not Applicable are excluded. Levels are [cumulative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) — AA includes all of A.

- **Rated** — applicable Level A and AA criteria.
- **Verified** — criteria confirmed by a test or a recorded review. The remainder are assessed from the source but not yet re-verified; they are flagged 🚩 in the component report. The flag concerns evidence, not conformance.
- **Automated** — criteria a deterministic test proves on its own, so they cannot silently regress.

<!-- scorecard-rollup:start -->

**No component records a ❌ Does Not Support rating for any Level A or AA criterion.**

Rolled up to the library level, where each criterion takes the worst rating any assessed component receives, 32 success criteria are exercised: **27 Supports, 5 Partially Supports, 0 Does Not Support.**

<!-- scorecard-rollup:end -->

The Level A and AA criteria absent from every row apply at the page or application level — [2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks), [3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-page), the [1.2.x Time-based Media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#time-based-media) set — and are the responsibility of the application.

## How to read the ratings

| Symbol | Term               | Meaning                                         |
| :----- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Supports           | Met, with no known defects.                     |
| ⚠️     | Partially Supports | Some functionality does not meet the criterion. |
| ❌     | Does Not Support   | Most functionality does not meet the criterion. |
| ➖     | Not Applicable     | The criterion does not apply to this component. |

Each criterion in a component report also records **who is responsible** for meeting it — ● the component, ◐ shared when used as documented, or ○ you, depending on your implementation and surrounding content. This distinction matters more for a component library than for an application, and the reports state it per criterion.

:::info
An application built with Material UI is not automatically accessible. Material UI supplies accessible building blocks; meeting WCAG for a finished product remains the responsibility of the team building it.

## Known gaps

Five issues account for every ⚠️ rating. Two of them can be fixed through the theme today.

| Gap                                                                                                 | Criteria      | Affected                                                         | Workaround                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| By default, the keyboard focus indicator is the ripple or a background tint, with untested contrast | 1.4.11        | AccordionSummary, Button, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Toggle Button | Enable `focusVisible` in your theme — see below            |
| Some default palette colors fall short of contrast minimums                                         | 1.4.3, 1.4.11 | Avatar, Button, LinearProgress, Switch, TextField, Toggle Button | Override the affected palette entries                      |
| The selected state of colored Toggle Buttons is conveyed almost entirely by hue                     | 1.4.1         | Toggle Button (`primary`, `error`, `info`, `success`)            | Add a non-color cue to the selected state, such as an icon |
| Dynamic state changes are not announced                                                             | 4.1.3         | Button (`loading`), LinearProgress, TextField (error)            | Render your own `aria-live` region alongside               |
| Indefinite animation cannot be paused                                                               | 2.2.2         | LinearProgress (`indeterminate`, `query`, `buffer`)              | Show it only while an operation is in flight               |

The theme's `focusVisible` option draws an outline ring on keyboard focus that does not depend on the ripple, so it also stays visible under `disableRipple`. See [Focus visible](/material-ui/customization/focus-visible/) for the options:

```js
const theme = createTheme({ focusVisible: true });
```

## Scope and limitations

:::warning
Read this section before citing the report.
:::

- **Component coverage is partial.** 12 components are assessed. Widely used components including Select, Autocomplete, Dialog, Menu, Table, Tabs, Slider, Tooltip, Snackbar, and Drawer are **not yet assessed**, and this report says nothing about them.
- **No assistive-technology testing.** No screen-reader passes have been performed. Criteria that depend on how a specific assistive technology behaves are assessed from the exposed accessibility tree, not from observed behavior.
- **Level AAA is out of scope**, as it is for a standard VPAT.
- **Components are rated in isolation**, as rendered with default props and the default theme. Customization, composition, and your surrounding page can change the result.
- **Evidence strength varies.** See the Verified column above; the shortfall is assessed from the source but not yet re-verified.
- **This is a self-assessment**, not audited by an independent third party.
- **Section 508 and EN 301 549 chapters are not yet included.** The WCAG results above supply the substance those chapters incorporate by reference, but the chapter-by-chapter mapping has not been written.

## Feedback

Accessibility defects are treated as bugs. Report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/new/choose) with the component, the success criterion, and steps to reproduce.
