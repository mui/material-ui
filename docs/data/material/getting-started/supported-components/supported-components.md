# Supported components

<p class="description">The following is a list of Material Design components & features.</p>

While we strive to follow the Material Design guidelines where practical (applying common sense where guidelines contradictâ€”which is more common than one might expect), we do not expect to support every component, nor every feature of every component, but rather to provide the building blocks to let developers create compelling user interfaces and experiences.

If you wish to add support for a component or feature not highlighted
here, please search for the relevant [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed), or create a new one
to discuss the approach before submitting a pull request.
