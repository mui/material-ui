# Supported components

<p class="description">The following is a list of Material Design components & features.</p>

While we strive to follow the Material Design guidelines where practical (applying
common sense where guidelines contradict - a more common occurrence than
one might expect), we do not expect to support every component, nor every
feature of every component, but rather to provide the building blocks to
allow developers to create compelling user interfaces and experiences.

If you wish to add support for a component or feature not highlighted
here, please search for the relevant [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed), or create a new one
to discuss the approach before submitting a pull request.
