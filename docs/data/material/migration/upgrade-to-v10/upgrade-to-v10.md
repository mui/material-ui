# Upgrade to v10

<p class="description">This guide explains how to upgrade from Material UI v9 to v10.</p>

## Breaking changes

Since v10 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from Material UI v9 to v10 are described below.

### Khmer locale renamed

The Khmer locale is now exported as `kmKH` instead of `khKH`, to match the ISO 639-1 code for Khmer (`km`).

```diff
-import { khKH } from '@mui/material/locale';
+import { kmKH } from '@mui/material/locale';

-const theme = createTheme(themeOptions, khKH);
+const theme = createTheme(themeOptions, kmKH);
```

Numbers in `TablePagination` are now formatted with the `km-KH` locale.
Previously, `Intl.NumberFormat` didn't recognize `kh-KH` and fell back to the runtime's default locale.
