# Upgrade to v7

<p class="description">This guide explains how to upgrade from Material UI v6 to v7.</p>

## Why you should upgrade to Material UI v7

### Improved ESM support

The package layout has been updated, and now unambiguously supports both valid ESM and CommonJS through the `exports` field in `package.json`.
You can read more about package exports in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_exports).

This update fixes several issues with popular bundlers like Vite and webpack, and makes it possible to load MUI packages from ES modules under Node.js.

### Quality-of-life improvements

Material UI v7 features other quality-of-life improvements, including:

- Standardization of the slot pattern across all components
- CSS layers support via the `enableCssLayer` prop in `StyledEngineProvider` for client-side apps, and `AppRouterCacheProvider` for Next.js App Router apps
- Removed deprecated APIs to reduce the API surface and make the docs easier to navigate

If you're using any of these packages, you should also update their versions to `"7.0.0"`:

- `@mui/icons-material`
- `@mui/system`
- `@mui/lab`
- `@mui/material-nextjs`
- `@mui/styled-engine`
- `@mui/styled-engine-sc`
- `@mui/utils`

Note that MUI X packages _do not_ follow the same versioning strategy as Material UI.
If you're using any of the following packages, they should remain unchanged during the upgrade process:

- `@mui/x-data-grid`
- `@mui/x-data-grid-pro`
- `@mui/x-data-grid-premium`
- `@mui/x-date-pickers`
- `@mui/x-date-pickers-pro`
- `@mui/x-charts`
- `@mui/x-tree-view`
- `@mui/x-tree-view-pro`

## Minimum TypeScript version

The minimum supported version of TypeScript has been increased from v4.7 to 4.9.

:::info
We align with [support window](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped?tab=readme-ov-file#support-window) by [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) (published on npm under the `@types` namespace).

We will not change the minimum supported version in a minor version of Material UI.
However, we recommend not using a TypeScript version older than the lowest supported version by DefinitelyTyped.
:::

For `@types/react*` packages, make sure they are the same major version as the `react` you are using.
Use the snippet below to update your project if needed (replace the `<version>` with the major version of `react` you are using):

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install @types/react@<version> @types/react-dom@<version>
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @types/react@<version> @types/react-dom@<version>
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @types/react@<version> @types/react-dom@<version>
```

</codeblock>

:::warning
Make sure that your application is still running without errors, and commit the changes before continuing to the next step.
:::

## React 18 and below

If you are using React 18 or below, you need to set up a resolution of `react-is` package to the same version as the `react` you are using.

For example, if you are using `react@18.3.1`, do the following steps:

1. Install `react-is@18.3.1`.

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install react-is@18.3.1
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add react-is@18.3.1
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react-is@18.3.1
```

</codeblock>

2. Set the resolutions or overrides in the `package.json`.

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```json npm
{
  …
  "overrides": {
    "react-is": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
```

```json pnpm
{
  …
  "overrides": {
    "react-is": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
```

```json yarn
{
  …
  "resolutions": {
    "react-is": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
```

</codeblock>

### Why is this needed?

Material UI v6 and v7 use `react-is@19`, which changed how React elements are identified.

React 18 uses `Symbol.for('react.element')` to identify React elements, but `react-is@19` uses `Symbol.for('react.transitional.element')` (aligned with React 19). When your app runs on React 18 but Material UI resolves `react-is@19`, the `PropTypes.node` validator fails to recognize valid React elements because they have different `$$typeof` symbols, causing warnings like:

```text
Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `children` supplied to `<Component>`, expected a ReactNode.
```

## Breaking changes

Since v7 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from Material UI v6 to v7 are described below.

### Package layout updated

The package layout has been updated to use the Node.js exports field. This brings several changes:

Deep imports with more than one level are no longer working, at all (they were already considered private API). For example:

```diff
-import createTheme from '@mui/material/styles/createTheme';
+import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
```

This was never officially supported, but now it will be restricted by bundlers and runtimes.

Modern bundles have also been removed, as the potential for a smaller bundle size is no longer significant.
If you've configured aliases for these bundles, you must remove them now.

```diff
 {
   resolve: {
     alias: {
-      '@mui/material': '@mui/material/modern',
-      '@mui/styled-engine': '@mui/styled-engine/modern',
-      '@mui/system': '@mui/system/modern',
-      '@mui/base': '@mui/base/modern',
-      '@mui/utils': '@mui/utils/modern',
-      '@mui/lab': '@mui/lab/modern',
     }
   }
 }
```

:::info
Earlier versions of this guide mention the existence of a `mui-modern` conditional exports.
This has since been removed.
This is a non-breaking change, and your bundler will fall back to the ESM bundle.
:::

If you are using a Vite alias to force ESM imports for the icons package, you should remove it as it's no longer necessary:

```diff
 // vite.config.js
   resolve: {
     alias: [
-      {
-        find: /^@mui\/icons-material\/(.*)/,
-        replacement: "@mui/icons-material/esm/$1",
-      },
     ],
   },
```

If you are augmenting the theme and using declarations for nested imports, you should replace them with `@mui/material/styles`. You may also have to rename an interface as some are exported from `@mui/material/styles` under a different name:

```diff
-declare module '@mui/material/styles/createTypography' {
+declare module '@mui/material/styles' {
-  interface TypographyOptions {
+  interface TypographyVariantsOptions {
     // ...
   }

-  interface Typography {
+  interface TypographyVariants {
     // ...
   }
 }
```

### Grid and Grid2 renamed

The deprecated `Grid` component has been renamed to `GridLegacy`.
The `Grid2` component has been moved to the `Grid` namespace.
Depending on your project, you may follow one of the following approaches:

1. **If you are using the deprecated grid and wish to upgrade,** run the following codemod:

   <!-- #npm-tag-reference -->

   ```bash
   npx @mui/codemod v7.0.0/grid-props <path/to/folder>
   ```

   See the [Grid upgrade guide](/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-grid-v2/) for more information.

2. **If you are using the deprecated grid and wish to continue using it,** update the `Grid` references as follows:

   ```diff
    // imports
   -import Grid, { gridClasses, GridProps } from '@mui/material/Grid';
   +import Grid, { gridLegacyClasses, GridLegacyProps } from '@mui/material/GridLegacy';

   -import { Grid } from '@mui/material';
   +import { GridLegacy as Grid } from '@mui/material';

    // theme
    const theme = createTheme({
      components: {
   -    MuiGrid: {
   +    MuiGridLegacy: {
          // ...
        },
      },
    });

    // CSS classes
   -.MuiGrid-root
   +.MuiGridLegacy-root
   ```

3. **If you are using Grid2,** update the `Grid2` references as follows:

   ```diff
    // imports
   -import Grid, { grid2Classes as gridClasses, Grid2Props as GridProps } from '@mui/material/Grid2';
   +import Grid, { gridClasses, GridProps } from '@mui/material/Grid';

   -import { Grid2 as Grid } from '@mui/material';
   +import { Grid } from '@mui/material';

    // theme
    const theme = createTheme({
      components: {
   -    MuiGrid2: {
   +    MuiGrid: {
          // ...
        },
      },
    });

    // CSS classes
   -.MuiGrid2-root
   +.MuiGrid-root
   ```

### InputLabel size prop standardized

The `size` prop for `InputLabel` now follows the standard naming convention used across other components like `Button` and `TextField`. `'normal'` has been replaced with `'medium'` for consistency.

If you were using `size="normal"`, update it to `size="medium"`:

```diff
-<InputLabel size="normal">Label</InputLabel>
+<InputLabel size="medium">Label</InputLabel>
```

The default behavior remains unchanged, so no updates are needed unless you explicitly set `size="normal"`.

Use this codemod to automatically update the `size` value:

<!-- #npm-tag-reference -->

```bash
npx @mui/codemod v7.0.0/input-label-size-normal-medium <path/to/folder>
```

### SvgIcon's data-testid removed

The default `data-testid` prop has been removed from the icons in `@mui/icons-material` in production bundles. This change ensures that the `data-testid` prop is only defined where needed, reducing the potential for naming clashes and removing unnecessary properties in production.

### TablePaginationActions types import path changed

The import path for the types has changed from `@mui/material/TablePagination/TablePaginationActions` to `@mui/material/TablePaginationActions`.

```diff
- import type { TablePaginationActionsProps } from '@mui/material/TablePagination/TablePaginationActions';
+ import type { TablePaginationActionsProps } from '@mui/material/TablePaginationActions';
```

### Theme behavior changes

When CSS theme variables is enabled with built-in light and dark color schemes, the theme no longer changes between modes.
The snippet below demonstrates this behavior when users toggle the dark mode, the `mode` state from `useColorScheme` changes, but the theme object no longer changes:

```js
import {
  ThemeProvider,
  createTheme,
  useTheme,
  useColorScheme,
} from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  cssVariables: {
    colorSchemeSelector: 'class',
  },
  colorSchemes: {
    light: true,
    dark: true,
  },
});
console.log(theme.palette.mode); // 'light' is the default mode

function ColorModeToggle() {
  const { setMode, mode } = useColorScheme();
  const theme = useTheme();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(mode); // logged 'light' at first render, and 'dark' after the button click
  }, [mode]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // logged 'light' at first render, no log after the button click
    console.log(theme.palette.mode);
  }, [theme]);

  return <button onClick={() => setMode('dark')}>Toggle dark mode</button>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <ColorModeToggle />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

This default behavior was made to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders when the mode changes.

It's recommended to use the `theme.vars.*` as values in your styles to refer to the CSS variables directly:

```js
const Custom = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.vars.palette.text.primary,
  background: theme.vars.palette.primary.main,
}));
```

If you need to do runtime calculations, we recommend using CSS instead of JavaScript whenever possible.
For example, adjusting the alpha channel of a color can be done using the [`color-mix` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix):

```js
const Custom = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
  color: `color-mix(in srgb, ${theme.vars.palette.text.primary}, transparent 50%)`,
}));
```

However, if CSS approach is not possible, you can access the value directly from the `theme.colorSchemes` object, then apply both light and dark styles:

```js
const Custom = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
  color: alpha(theme.colorSchemes.light.palette.text.primary, 0.5),
  ...theme.applyStyles('dark', {
    color: alpha(theme.colorSchemes.dark.palette.text.primary, 0.5),
  }),
}));
```

If any of the methods above do not suit your project, you can opt out from this behavior by passing the `forceThemeRerender` prop to the ThemeProvider component:

```js
<ThemeProvider forceThemeRerender />
```

### Deprecated APIs removed

APIs that were deprecated in v5 have been removed in v7.

#### createMuiTheme function

The deprecated `createMuiTheme` function has been removed.
Use `createTheme` instead.

```diff
-import { createMuiTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
+import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
```

#### Dialog's onBackdropClick prop

The deprecated `onBackdropClick` prop has been removed from the `Dialog` component.
Please use the [`onClose`](/material-ui/api/dialog/#dialog-prop-onClose) callback instead, which receives the event and the reason for the dialog closing.
Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  const handleClose = (event, reason) => {
    if (reason === 'backdropClick') {
      // Handle the backdrop click
    }
    setOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={handleClose}>
      {/* Dialog content */}
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

#### experimentalStyled function

The deprecated `experimentalStyled` function has been removed.
Use `styled` instead.

```diff
-import { experimentalStyled as styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
+import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
```

#### Hidden and PigmentHidden components

The deprecated `Hidden` and `PigmentHidden` components have been removed.

Use the `sx` prop to replace `implementation="css"`:

```diff
-<Hidden implementation="css" xlUp><Paper /></Hidden>
+<Paper sx={{ display: { xl: 'none', xs: 'block' } }} />
```

```diff
-<Hidden implementation="css" mdDown><Paper /></Hidden>
+<Paper sx={{ display: { xs: 'none', md: 'block' } }} />
```

Use the `useMediaQuery` hook to replace `implementation="js"`:

```diff
-<Hidden implementation="js" xlUp><Paper /></Hidden>
+const hidden = useMediaQuery(theme => theme.breakpoints.up('xl'));
+return hidden ? null : <Paper />;
```

#### Modal's onBackdropClick prop

The deprecated `onBackdropClick` prop has been removed from the `Modal` component.
Please use the [`onClose`](/material-ui/api/modal/#modal-prop-onClose) callback instead, which receives the event and the reason for the modal closing.
Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  const handleClose = (event, reason) => {
    if (reason === 'backdropClick') {
      // Handle the backdrop click
    }
    setOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <Modal open={open} onClose={handleClose}>
      {/* Modal content */}
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

#### Rating's MuiRating-readOnly CSS class

The deprecated `MuiRating-readOnly` class was removed in favor of `Mui-readOnly` global class.

```diff
-.MuiRating-readOnly
+.Mui-readOnly
```

#### StepButtonIcon type

The deprecated `StepButtonIcon` type has been removed. Use `StepButtonProps['icon']` instead.

```diff
-import { StepButtonIcon } from '@mui/material/StepButton';
+import { StepButtonProps } from '@mui/material/StepButton';

-StepButtonIcon
+StepButtonProps['icon']
```

#### StyledEngineProvider import path

Importing `StyledEngineProvider` from `'@mui/material'` was deprecated and now has been removed.
Import it from `'@mui/material/styles'` instead:

```diff
-import { StyledEngineProvider } from '@mui/material';
+import { StyledEngineProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
```

#### Lab components moved to the main package

The following `@mui/lab` components and hook have been moved to `@mui/material`:

- Alert
- AlertTitle
- Autocomplete
- AvatarGroup
- Pagination
- PaginationItem
- Rating
- Skeleton
- SpeedDial
- SpeedDialAction
- SpeedDialIcon
- ToggleButton
- ToggleButtonGroup
- usePagination

To keep using these components and hook, import them from `@mui/material` instead of `@mui/lab`.

```diff
-import Alert from '@mui/lab/Alert';
+import Alert from '@mui/material/Alert';

-import { Alert } from '@mui/lab';
+import { Alert } from '@mui/material';
```

Use this codemod to automatically update the imports:

<!-- #npm-tag-reference -->

```bash
npx @mui/codemod v7.0.0/lab-removed-components <path/to/folder>
```

:::warning
The codemod doesn't cover type imports associated with the components.
