# Upgrade to v9

<p class="description">This guide explains how to upgrade from Material UI v7 to v9.</p>

## Start using the alpha release

In the `package.json` file, change the package version from `latest` to `next`.

```diff title="package.json"
-"@mui/material": "latest",
+"@mui/material": "next",
```

Using `next` ensures your project always uses the latest v9 pre-releases.
Alternatively, you can also target and fix it to a specific version, for example, `9.0.0-alpha.0`.

## Breaking changes

Since v9 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from Material UI v7 to v9 are described below.

This list is a work in progress.
Expect updates as new breaking changes are introduced.

### Dialog & Modal

The `disableEscapeKeyDown` prop has been removed. The same behavior could be achieved
by checking the value of the `reason` argument in `onClose`:

```diff
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true);
- const handleClose = () => {
-   setOpen(false);
- };
+ const handleClose = (_event: React.SyntheticEvent<unknown>, reason: string) => {
+   if (reason !== 'escapeKeyDown') {
+     setOpen(false);
+   }
+ };
  return (
-  <Dialog open={open} disableEscapeKeyDown onClose={handleClose}>
+  <Dialog open={open} onClose={handleClose}>
    {/* ... */}
  </Dialog>
  );
```

The `Modal` change is the same.

### ButtonBase

#### Click event propagation from Enter and Spacebar

When sending Enter and Spacebar keys on the ButtonBase or components that are composed from ButtonBase,
the click event now bubbles to their ancestors.

Also, the `event` passed to the `onClick` prop is a `MouseEvent` instead of the `KeyboardEvent` captured
in the ButtonBase keyboard handlers. This is actually the expected behavior.

### Autocomplete

#### Listbox toggle on right click

The listbox does not toggle anymore when using right click on the input. The left click toggle behavior remains unchanged.

#### freeSolo type related changes

When the `freeSolo` prop is passed as `true`, the `getOptionLabel` and `isOptionEqualToValue` props
accept `string` as well for their `option` and, respectively, `value` arguments:

```diff
- isOptionEqualToValue?: (option: Value, value: Value) => boolean;
+ isOptionEqualToValue?: (
+  option: Value,
+  value: AutocompleteValueOrFreeSoloValueMapping<Value, FreeSolo>,
+ ) => boolean;
```

```diff
- getOptionLabel?: (option: Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo>) => string;
+ getOptionLabel?: (option: AutocompleteValueOrFreeSoloValueMapping<Value, FreeSolo>) => string;
```

For reference:

```ts
type AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo> = FreeSolo extends true
  ? string
  : never;

type AutocompleteValueOrFreeSoloValueMapping<Value, FreeSolo> = FreeSolo extends true
  ? Value | string
  : Value;
```
