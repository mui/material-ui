# Upgrade to v9

<p class="description">This guide explains how to upgrade from Material UI v7 to v9.</p>

## Start using the alpha release

In the `package.json` file, change the package version from `latest` to `next`.

```diff title="package.json"
-"@mui/material": "latest",
+"@mui/material": "next",
```

Using `next` ensures your project always uses the latest v9 pre-releases.
Alternatively, you can also target and fix it to a specific version, for example, `9.0.0-alpha.0`.

## Breaking changes

Since v9 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from Material UI v7 to v9 are described below.

### Dialog & Modal

The `disableEscapeKeyDown` prop has been removed. The same behavior could be achieved
by checking the value of the `reason` argument in `onClose`:

```diff
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true);
- const handleClose = () => {
-   setOpen(false);
- };
+ const handleClose = (_event: React.SyntheticEvent<unknown>, reason: string) => {
+   if (reason !== 'escapeKeyDown') {
+     setOpen(false);
+   }
+ };
  return (
-  <Dialog open={open} disableEscapeKeyDown onClose={handleClose}>
+  <Dialog open={open} onClose={handleClose}>
    {/* ... */}
  </Dialog>
  );
```

The `Modal` change is the same.
