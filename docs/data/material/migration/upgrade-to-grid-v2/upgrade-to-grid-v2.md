# Upgrade to Grid2

<p class="description">This guide explains how and why to migrate from the Grid component to the Grid2 component.</p>

## Grid component versions

In Material UI v7, the legacy Grid component has been deprecated and replaced by Grid2, which offers several new features as well as significant improvements to the developer experience.
This guide explains how to upgrade from Grid to Grid2, and includes details for Material UI v5, v6, and v7.

## Why you should upgrade

Grid2 provides the following improvements over the legacy Grid:

- It uses CSS variables, removing CSS specificity from class selectors.
  You can use `sx` prop on Grid2 to control any style you'd like.
- All grids are considered items without specifying the `item` prop.
- The [offset feature](/material-ui/react-grid2/#offset) gives you more flexibility for positioning.
- [Nested grids](/material-ui/react-grid2/#nested-grid) now have no depth limitation.
- Its implementation doesn't use negative margins so it doesn't [overflow like the legacy Grid](/material-ui/react-grid-legacy/#negative-margin).

## How to upgrade

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this upgrade:

- You must be on Material UI v5+.
- If you're in the process of upgrading your Material UI version, you should complete that upgrade first.

### 1. Update the import

Depending on the Material UI version you are using, you must update the import as follows:

<codeblock storageKey="material-ui-version">

```diff v7
// The legacy Grid component is named GridLegacy
-import Grid from '@mui/material/GridLegacy';

// The updated Grid component is named Grid2
+import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid2';

```

```diff v6
// The legacy Grid component is named Grid
-import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';

// The updated Grid component is named Grid2
+import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid2';
```

```diff v5
// The legacy Grid component is named Grid
-import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';

// The updated Grid component is named Unstable_Grid2
+import Grid from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2';
```

</codeblock>

### 2. Remove legacy props

The `item` and `zeroMinWidth` props have been removed in the updated Grid.
You can safely remove them:

```diff
-<Grid item zeroMinWidth>
+<Grid>
```

### 3. Update the size props

:::warning
Skip this step if you're using Material UI v5.
:::

In the legacy Grid, the size props were named to correspond with the theme's breakpoints.
For the default theme, these were `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`.

Starting from Material UI v6, these props are renamed to `size` on the updated Grid:

```diff
 <Grid
-  xs={12}
-  sm={6}
+  size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6 }}
 >
```

If the size is the same for all breakpoints, then you can use a single value:

```diff
-<Grid xs={6}>
+<Grid size={6}>
```

Additionally, the `true` value for the size props was renamed to `"grow"`:

```diff
-<Grid xs>
+<Grid size="grow">
```

You can use the following codemod to update the size props:

```bash v6
npx @mui/codemod@latest v6.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder>
```

:::warning
The codemod requires [updating the imports](#update-the-import) beforehand.
:::

### 4. Opt in to legacy negative margins

:::warning
Skip this step if you're using Material UI v6 or v7.
:::

If you're using Material UI v5 and want to apply the negative margins similar to the legacy Grid, specify `disableEqualOverflow={true}` on the grid container.
To apply to all grids, add the default props to the theme:

```js
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import Grid from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2';

const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiGrid2: {
      defaultProps: {
        // all grids under this theme will apply
        // negative margin on the top and left sides.
        disableEqualOverflow: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Grid container>...grids</Grid>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Common issues

### Column direction

Using `direction="column"` or `direction="column-reverse"` is not supported on [the legacy Grid](/material-ui/react-grid-legacy/#direction-column-column-reverse) nor on [the updated Grid2](/material-ui/react-grid2/#column-direction).
If your layout used the legacy Grid with these values, it might break when you switch to the updated Grid.
If you need a vertical layout, follow the instructions in the [Grid2 documentation](/material-ui/react-grid2/#column-direction).
