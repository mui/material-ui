# Minimizing bundle size

<p class="description">Learn how to reduce your bundle size and improve development performance by avoiding costly import patterns.</p>

## Bundle size matters

Material¬†UI's maintainers take bundle size very seriously. Size snapshots are taken on every commit for every package and critical parts of those packages. Combined with [dangerJS](https://danger.systems/js/), we can inspect [detailed bundle size changes](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/14638#issuecomment-466658459) on every Pull Request.

## Avoid barrel imports

Modern bundlers already tree-shake unused code in production builds, so you don't need to worry about it when using top-level imports. The real performance concern is during **development**, where **barrel imports** like `@mui/material` or `@mui/icons-material` can cause significantly **slower startup and rebuild times**.

```js
// ‚úÖ Preferred
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import TextField from '@mui/material/TextField';
```

Instead of:

```js
// ‚ùå Slower in dev
import { Button, TextField } from '@mui/material';
```

This is especially true when using `@mui/icons-material`, where named imports can be up to six times slower than default path-based imports:

```js
// üêå Slower in dev
import { Delete } from '@mui/icons-material';

// üöÄ Faster in dev
import Delete from '@mui/icons-material/Delete';
```

This approach avoids loading unnecessary parts of the package and does not require any special configuration. It is also the default used in all our official examples and demos.

## Enforce best practices with ESLint

To prevent accidental deep imports, you can use the `no-restricted-imports` rule in your ESLint configuration:

```json
// .eslintrc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        "patterns": [{ "regex": "^@mui/[^/]+$" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Avoid VS¬†Code auto-importing from barrel files

To prevent VS¬†Code from automatically importing from `@mui/material`, you can use the `typescript.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes` in the VS¬†Code project configuration:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": ["^@mui/[^/]+$"]
}
```

## Using Next.js 13.5 or later?

If you're on **Next.js 13.5 or newer**, you're in good hands. These versions include automatic import optimization via the `optimizePackageImports` option. This removes the need for manual configuration or Babel plugins to optimize imports.
