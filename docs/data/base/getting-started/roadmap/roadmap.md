# Roadmap

<p class="description">Keep up with ongoing projects and help shape the future of MUI Base.</p>

## How we prioritize

MUI Base is a community-driven project, meaning we usually pick the issues and suggestions that resonate the most with the community.
Therefore, make sure to leave an upvote 👍 on [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/issues) you are most interested in.

Additionally, we conduct annual [developer surveys](/blog/?tags=Developer+survey/) which also serve as key inputs for MUI Base's roadmap.
Your participation is invaluable—keep an eye on MUI's social media to catch the next survey and help shape the future of the library!

## Keeping track of the roadmap

### GitHub project

The MUI Base GitHub project is where you can see the ongoing priorities for the library.
We typically add umbrella issues to the project board after discussing them internally.
