# Snackbar

<p class="description">The Snackbar, also commonly referred to as Toast, component informs users that an action has been or will be performed by the app.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Introduction

Snackbars are designed to provide brief, non-intrusive notifications to users, informing them about processes an app has performed or will perform.

By default, the snackbar is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen. They are designed not to disrupt the user's workflow and can be dismissed automatically without the need of any user interaction.

Snackbars contain a single line of text directly related to the operation performed. They can contain text actions, but no icons.

{{"demo": "SnackbarUsage.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Basics

```jsx
import Snackbar from '@mui/joy/Snackbar';
```

### Position

The position of the snackbar can be controlled by specifying the `anchorOrigin` prop.

In wider layouts, snackbars can be aligned to the left or centered, especially if they are consistently positioned in a specific location at the bottom of the screen. However, in some cases, you may need more flexible positioning.

{{"demo": "PositionedSnackbar.js"}}

## Customization

### Variants

The Snackbar component supports Joy UI's four [global variants](/joy-ui/main-features/global-variants/): `plain`, `outlined` (default), `soft`, and `solid`.

{{"demo": "SnackbarVariants.js"}}

:::info
To learn how to add your own variants, check out [Themed components—Extend variants](/joy-ui/customization/themed-components/#extend-variants).
Note that you lose the global variants when you add custom variants.

### Sizes

The Snackbar component comes in three sizes: `sm`, `md` (default), and `lg`.

### Colors

Every palette included in the theme is available via the `color` prop.
Play around combining different colors with different variants.

{{"demo": "SnackbarColors.js"}}

### Hide duration

Use `autoHideDuration` prop to control how long the Snackbar is displayed. If it is not provided, the Snackbar will be displayed until the user dismisses it.

{{"demo": "SnackbarHideDuration.js"}}

### Close reason

There are three reasons for the Snackbar to close:

- `timeout`: The Snackbar is closed after the `autoHideDuration` prop timer expires.
- `clickaway`: The Snackbar is closed when the user interacts outside of the Snackbar.
- `escapeKeyDown`: The Snackbar is closed when the user presses the escape key.

You can access the value from the second argument of the `onClose` callback.

```js
<Snackbar onClose={(event, reason) => {
  // reason will be one of: timeout, clickaway, escapeKeyDown
}}>
```

{{"demo": "SnackbarCloseReason.js"}}

#### Ignore clickaway

This pattern is useful when you don't want the Snackbar to close when the user clicks outside of it.

```js
<Snackbar
  onClose={(event, reason) => {
    if (reason === 'clickaway') {
      return;
    }
  }}
>
```

### Decorators

Use the `startDecorator` and `endDecorator` props to append icons and/or actions to either side of the Snackbar.

{{"demo": "SnackbarWithDecorators.js"}}

### Inverted colors

When the Snackbar's variant is `soft` or `solid`, you can set `invertedColors` prop to `true` to invert the colors of the children for increasing the contrast.

To learn more about this, check out [Color Inversion](/joy-ui/main-features/color-inversion/) feature.

{{"demo": "SnackbarInvertedColors.js"}}

### Animation

To apply a custom animation, provide the `animationDuration` prop, which we'll use to match the component's unmount animation accurately.
