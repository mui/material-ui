# Link

<p class="description">The Link component lets you customize anchor tags with theme colors and typography styles.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Introduction

The Joy UI Link component replaces the native HTML `<a>` element and accepts the same props as the [Typography](/joy-ui/react-typography/) component, as well as MUI System props.

{{"demo": "LinkUsage.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Basics

```jsx
import Link from '@mui/joy/Link';
```

The Joy UI Link behaves similar to the native HTML `<a>`, so it renders with an underline by default and has no background color on hover.

The demo below shows the two basic states available to the Link: default and disabled.
Don't forget to always assign an `href` value:

{{"demo": "BasicsLink.js"}}

## Customization

### Variants

The Link component supports Joy UI's four global variants: `plain` (default), `soft`, `outlined`, and `solid`.

:::warning
Although the component is technically set to `plain` by default, it will actually render without any variant if you don't customize it.
This is so that it adheres to the standard visual design of links on the web (no background color on hover).
:::

{{"demo": "LinkVariants.js"}}

:::info
To learn how to add your own variants, check out [Themed components—Extend variants](/joy-ui/customization/themed-components/#extend-variants).
Note that you lose the global variants when you add custom variants.

### Levels

The Link component comes with all the Typography levels to choose from.

{{"demo": "LinkLevels.js"}}

### Colors

Every palette included in the theme is available via the `color` prop.
Play around combining different colors with different variants.

{{"demo": "LinkColors.js"}}

### Underline

Use the `underline` prop to control how the underline behaves on the Link component.
It comes with three values: `hover`, `always`, and `none`.

{{"demo": "LinkUnderline.js"}}

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable interaction and focus:

{{"demo": "LinkDisabled.js"}}

### Overlay prop

Use the `overlay` prop to make an entire component clickable as a link.
The demo below shows how to use that with the Card component, ensuring proper accessibility.

{{"demo": "LinkCard.js"}}

### As a button

To use the Link component as a button, assign the `button` value to the `component` prop.
This can be useful in two situations:

1. The link doesn't have a meaningful href.
2. The design looks more like a button than a link.

```js
<Link
  component="button"
  onClick={() => {
    // ...process something
  }}
>
  Do something
</Link>
```

### Usage with Typography

The Link component can be used as a child of the [Typography](/joy-ui/react-typography/) component.
In this situation, the Link will inherit the typographic level scale from its Typography parent, unless you specify a value for the `level` prop on the Link itself.

## Third-party routing library

The sections below explain how to integrate the Link component with third-party tools that have their own comparable component.

### Next.js Pages Router

Here is an example with the [Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) of Next.js:

```js
import NextLink from 'next/link';
import Link from '@mui/joy/Link';

<NextLink href="/docs" passHref>
  <Link>Read doc</Link>
</NextLink>;
```

### React Router

Here is a demo with the [Link component](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/navigating#link) of [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router).

```js
import { Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router';
import Link from '@mui/joy/Link';

<Link component={RouterLink} to="/docs">
  Read doc
</Link>;
```

## Security

When using `target="_blank"` with links to pages on another site, the [Google Chrome Developers documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener) recommends adding `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` to avoid potential security issues.

- `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.
- `rel="noreferrer"` has the same effect, but also prevents the _Referer_ header from being sent to a new page.
  Note that removing the referrer header will affect analytics.

## Accessibility

Here are a few tips for ensuring an accessible link component, based on [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/link/).

- **Copywriting:** Avoid generic words as calls to action, such as "click here" or "go to".
  Instead, use [descriptive text](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/descriptive-link-text) to inform the user about what they'll find when they click the link.
- **Design:** For a good user experience, links should stand out from the text on the page.
  Keeping the default `underline="always"` behavior is a safe bet.
- **Href:** If a link doesn't have a meaningful href, [it should be rendered using a `<button>` element](#as-button).
