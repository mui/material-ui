# Upgrade to v6

<p class="description">This guide explains how to upgrade from MUI System v5 to v6.</p>

## Start using the beta release

In the `package.json` file, change the package version from `latest` to `next`.

```diff title="package.json"
-"@mui/system": "latest",
+"@mui/system": "next",
```

Using `next` ensures your project always uses the latest v6 beta release.
Alternatively, you can also target and fix it to a specific version, for example, `6.0.0-beta.0`.

## Breaking changes

Since v6 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from MUI System v5 to v6 are described below.

:::info
This list is a work in progress.
Expect updates as new breaking changes are introduced.

### Root code is now ESM

The ESM code, previously under the `esm/` build, has been moved to the root of the package.
The CommonJS code, previously on the root, has been moved to the `node/` build.

:::info
This is an intermediate step to prepare for adding the `exports` field to the `package.json` file.
If you have trouble using this new structure, please wait for the future update which adds the `exports` field.
You can follow progress on https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/30671.

### Grid

The `Grid` component was updated and stabilized:

- The previous size (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, ...) and offset (`xsOffset`, `smOffset`, `mdOffset`, ...) props, which were named after the theme's breakpoints, were replaced with the `size` and `offset` props.
- The spacing mechanism was reworked to use the `gap` CSS property.

This brings some breaking changes described in the following sections.

#### Stabilized API

The `Grid` component API was stabilized, so its import no longer contains the `Unstable_` prefix:

```diff
- import { Unstable_Grid as Grid } from '@mui/system';
+ import { Grid } from '@mui/system';
```

```diff
- import Grid from '@mui/system/Unstable_Grid';
+ import Grid from '@mui/system/Grid';
```

#### Size and offset props

Previously, the size and offset props were named corresponding to the theme's breakpoints.
For the default theme this was:

- Size: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
- Offset: `xsOffset`, `smOffset`, `mdOffset`, `lgOffset`, `xlOffset`

In v6, these props are renamed to `size` and `offset`:

```diff
 <Grid
-  xs={12}
-  sm={6}
-  xsOffset={2}
-  smOffset={3}
+  size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6 }}
+  offset={{ xs: 2, sm: 3 }}
  >
```

Note that if the size or offset is the same for all breakpoints, you can use a single value:

```diff
-<Grid xs={6} xsOffset={2}>
+<Grid size={6} offset={2}>
```

Besides that, the `true` value for the size prop was renamed to `"grow"`:

```diff
-<Grid xs>
+<Grid size="grow">
```

Use this codemod to migrate your project to the new size and offset props:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@latest v6.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder>
```

:::warning
You need to modify the import from `@mui/system/Unstable_Grid` to `@mui/system/Grid` before running the codemod.
:::

If you have custom breakpoints, the change is the same:

```diff
-<Grid mobile={12} mobileOffset={2} desktop={6} desktopOffset={4}>
+<Grid size={{ mobile: 12, desktop: 6 }} offset={{ mobile: 2, desktop: 4 }}>
```

Which you can cover with the same codemod by providing the custom breakpoints as an argument:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@latest v6.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder> --jscodeshift='--muiBreakpoints=mobile,desktop'
```

#### Removal of the disableEqualOverflow prop

Previously, the Grid overflowed its parent.
In v6, this is fixed, with the Grid being contained inside its parent's padding:

<img src="/static/material-ui/migration-v5/grid-overflow-change.png" style="width: 814px;" alt="Before and after of the Grid no longer overflowing its parent in v6." width="1628" height="400" />

This removes the need for the `disableEqualOverflow` prop:

```diff
-<Grid disableEqualOverflow>
+<Grid>
```

#### Spacing is no longer considered inside the Grid item's box

Previously, Grid items included spacing in their boxes.
In v6, this is fixed:

<img src="/static/material-ui/migration-v5/grid-spacing-change.png" style="width: 814px;" alt="Before and after of the Grid items no longer including spacing in their box." width="1628" height="400" />

:::warning
Both of these changes might slightly affect your layout.
Note that the items' position doesn't change.
We recommend adopting this new behavior and **not trying to replicate the old one**, as this is a more predictable and modern approach.
:::

### GridProps type

The `cssGrid` function's `GridProps` type has been renamed to `CssGridProps`.
This is to avoid collision with the `GridProps` type corresponding to the `Grid` component props.
