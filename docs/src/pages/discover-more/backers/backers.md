## FAQ

#### What's the difference between Patreon and OpenCollective?

Funds received via Patreon or other forms go to a for-profit entity that employs some of the [core team](/discover-more/team/) members. It directly support [our mission](/company/about/#our-mission).

Funds donated via OpenCollective (sponsorship) are managed transparently and aimed to sustain the MIT core of Material-UI. Material-UI benefits from the Open Collective's fiscal sponsorship (hosted as a non-profit), in exchange for 10% of the donations.

#### Is sponsorship required to use Material-UI?

Users are not legally required to give back to the Material-UI project, but it is in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals and reducing running costs, Material-UI results in huge time and money savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of these savings back, enabling the project to advance more rapidly and result in even greater savings for your organization.

#### How is sponsorship money spent?

Sponsorship money is used to fund software development, testing, documentation, and releases of the Material-UI software suite.
We aim for one developper full-time for every $4k/month to $10k/month funding we collect.
The funds are managed transparently.

#### Why is Material-UI a "crowd-funded open-source project"?

The core of Material-UI is open-source to give users great freedom in how they use the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the project progresses to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To make Material-UI a project that users can rely on for years to come, it needs to be well directed and financially sustainable.

The absolute best way to support Material-UI’s ongoing development efforts is to become a sponsor. Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend the most time directly working on improving Material-UI core, which you and other Material-UI users then benefit from.
