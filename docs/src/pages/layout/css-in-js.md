# CSS in JS

Sometimes wrapping things inside a component does't make much sense when all you
what you want to achieve can be handled by a small CSS change. By using the
`breakpoints` attribute of the theme you can utilise the same breakpoints used
for the [Grid](/layout/grid) and [Hidden](/layout/hidden) components.

This can be accomplished using [CSS-in-JS](/customization/css-in-js).
