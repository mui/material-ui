# Selects

## Simple Select

Menus are positioned over their emitting elements such that the currently selected menu item appears on top of the emitting element.

## Native Select

As the user experience can be improved on mobile using the native select of the platform,
we allow such pattern.

It's enabled with the `multiple` property.
