# Pickers

Pickers provide a simple way to select a single value from a pre-determined set.

- On mobile, pickers are best suited for display in confirmation dialog.
- For inline display, such as on a form, consider using compact controls such as segmented dropdown buttons.

#### Notice

We are currently falling back to **native input controls**.
If you are interested in implementing or have implemented a rich Material Design Picker with an awesome UX, please, let us know on [#4787](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/4787) and [#4796](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/4796)! We could add a link to or a demo of your project in the documentation.
Here are some components that are **promising**:
