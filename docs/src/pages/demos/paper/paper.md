# Paper

In material design, the physical properties of [paper](https://material.google.com/layout/principles.html#principles-how-paper-works) are translated to the screen.
The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper, and an application’s behavior mimics paper’s ability to be re-sized, shuffled, and bound together in multiple sheets.
