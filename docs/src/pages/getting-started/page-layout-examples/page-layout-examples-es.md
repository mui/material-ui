# Ejemplos de Diseño de Páginas

<p class="description">A selection of basic page layouts to help you get started building your app.</p>

They can be combined with one of the [example applications](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files, making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example) for reuse in other pages.

For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes the purpose of each file.

{{"demo": "pages/getting-started/page-layout-examples/PageLayoutExamples.js", "hideHeader": true}}

If while using these examples you make changes or enhancements that could improve the developer experience, or you would like to contribute an additional example, please consider creating a [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pulls).

So far we have demos for:

- A dashboard
- A Sign In page
- A Sign Up page
- A blog page
- A checkout flow
- An album page
- A pricing page
- A sticky footer page
