# Learn Material-UI

<p class="description">New to Material-UI? It's easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.</p>

People come to Material-UI from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.
Like any unfamiliar technology, Material-UI does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will soon get the hang of it.

## First Example

The [usage page](/getting-started/usage/#quick-start) contains a small Material-UI example with a live editor.
Even if you don’t know anything about Material-UI yet, try changing the code and see how it affects the result.

## Example Projects

We [host some example projects](/getting-started/example-projects/) providing the infrastructure needed to develop and deploy websites in React.

## Page layout examples

We have a [selection of basic page layouts](/getting-started/page-layout-examples/) to help you get started building your app.

## Recommended resources

When first learning Material-UI, you might find third-party blog posts, books and video courses more helpful than the official documentation.
