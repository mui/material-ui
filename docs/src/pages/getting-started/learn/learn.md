# Learn MUI

<p class="description">New to MUI? It's easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.</p>

Developers come to MUI from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.
Like any unfamiliar technology, MUI does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will soon get the hang of it.

## First example

The [usage page](/getting-started/usage/#quick-start) contains a small MUI example with a live editor.
Even if you don't know anything about MUI yet, try changing the code and see how it affects the result.

## Example projects

There are [some example projects](/getting-started/example-projects/) available, providing the infrastructure needed to develop and deploy websites in React.

## Templates

This [selection of basic templates](/getting-started/templates/) will help you get started building your app.
