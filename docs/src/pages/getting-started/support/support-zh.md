### GitHub <img src="/static/images/logos/github.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="GitHub logo" loading="lazy" />

MUI uses GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker. 如果你认为发现了一个 bug，或有一个新功能的想法，在您提交之前，请先确保它没有被 [报告过或解决过](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed)。  您可以搜索已有的 Issues 或者 Pull Requests，这样可以知晓是否有人已报告过类似的问题。

- [Open an issue on MUI X](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/issues/new/choose)

#### 新 Issue 指南

- Please follow the issue template.
- Please begin the title with '[ComponentName]' where appropriate, and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - "doesn't work" ❌
  - "[Button] Add support for <some feature>" ✅
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue – each should have its own issue instead.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (👍).

### 支持的版本

MUI Core has been open-source ([MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure MUI is the right choice for their React applications through MUI's community maintenance strategy. The MUI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

Given the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://mui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v5](/guides/migration-v4/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.

The current status of each MUI version is as follows:

- MUI Core v5 (emotion): ✅ In active development.
- MUI Core v4 (hooks): ⚠️ Only handle security fixes.
- MUI Core v3 (change supported browsers): ❌ Inactive.
- ~MUI Core v2 (never existed)~.
- MUI Core v1 (rewrite): ❌ Inactive.
- MUI Core v0.x: ❌ Inactive.

For teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, MUI has [options available](#professional-support-premium).

## 专业支持（高级）

### Pro/Premium plans

MUI comes in [three plans](/pricing/). The support available on the Community plan is mostly made possible thanks to people like you: the community. It's described in more detail in the above section. The maintainers of MUI focuses on solving the root issues, not direct support.

The Pro plan allows developers to license extra features that are challenging to find in the OSS space. The maintainers of MUI provide support for these paid features. They aim for a similar quality of experience to the one provided by the community on the open-source modules however no SLAs are provided.

The Premium plan goes one step further by providing SLAs on the quality of the support.

### Tidelift subscription <img src="/static/images/logos/tidelift.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="Tidelift logo" loading="lazy" />

MUI and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open-source you use.

If you want the flexibility of open-source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is worth looking at.

The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you:

- Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open-source software that your application depends on.
- Your subscription helps pay the open-source community maintainers of the packages you use, to ensure they meet the standards you require.
- Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert participating open-source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
- Tidelift helps measure and improve your open-source dependencies' health – which improves your app's health – and gives a shortlist of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
- Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open-source packages, such as intellectual property indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications – and your business.
