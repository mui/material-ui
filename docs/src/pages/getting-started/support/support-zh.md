### GitHub <img src="/static/images/logos/github.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="GitHub logo" loading="lazy" />

我们用GitHub issues作为唯一的记录BUG或特性需求的跟踪方式。 如果你认为发现了BUG，或有一个新特性的想法，请在开始前先确保它没有被[报告过或解决过](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed)。 您可以在现存的Issues或Pull Requests中搜索，以了解是否有人报告过类似的问题。

#### 新Issue指南

- 请遵循Issue模板
- 请标题以'[ComponentName]'[开始，并用合适的、简洁的描述来帮助其他人找到类似问题。 
  - "不工作 ❌
  - "[Button] 增加对于... 的支持 <some feature>" ✅
- 请不要在一个Issue中打包多个话题 - 取而代之的，是每一个话题都应该有他自己的Issue。
- 请不要在Issue评论中回复“+1” 它相当于向维护者发送垃圾信息，也无法使问题取得进展。 可以用GitHub的表情来替代 (👍).

### Supported versions

The Material-UI CE (Community Edition) has been 100% open-source (MIT) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure Material-UI is the right choice for their React applications through Material-UI’s community maintenance strategy. The Material-UI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

Given the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://material-ui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v4](/guides/migration-v3/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.

The current status of each Material-UI version is as follows:

- Material-UI v4 (hooks): ✅ In active development.
- Material-UI v3 (change supported browsers): ⚠️ Only handle security fixes.
- ~Material-UI v2 (never existed)~.
- Material-UI v1 (rewrite): ❌ Inactive.
- Material-UI v0.x: ❌ Inactive.

For teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, Material-UI has [options available](#enterprise).

### Tidelift subscription <img src="/static/images/logos/tidelift.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="Tidelift logo" loading="lazy" />

Material-UI and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open-source you use.

If you want the flexibility of open-source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is worth looking at.

The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you:

- Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open-source software that your application depends on.
- Your subscription helps pay the open-source community maintainers of the packages you use, to ensure they meet the standards you require.
- Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert participating open-source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
- Tidelift helps measure and improve your open-source dependencies' health – which improves your app's health – and gives a shortlist of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
- Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open-source packages, such as intellectual property indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications – and your business.
