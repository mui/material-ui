# Supported Platforms

## Browser

Material-UI supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.
We also support Internet Explorer 11.
We don't require any JavaScript polyfill from our users. We manage unsupported browser features internally and in isolation.

| IE    | Edge   | Firefox | Chrome | Safari |
|:------|:-------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| 11    | >= 14  | >= 45   | >= 49  | >= 10  |

## Server

Because Material-UI is supporting server side rendering, we need to support the latest, stable releases of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).
We try to support the [last active LTS version](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule1). Right now, we support **node@6.11** and newer version.
