# Select

<p class="description">Select components are used for collecting user provided information from a list of options.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Basic select

Menus are positioned over their emitting elements such that the currently selected menu item appears on top of the emitting element.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/BasicSelect.js"}}

## Advanced features

The Select component is meant to be interchangeable with a native `<select>` element.

If you are looking for more advanced features, like combobox, multiselect, autocomplete, async or creatable support, head to the [`Autocomplete` component](/components/autocomplete/).
It's meant to be an improved version of the "react-select" and "downshift" packages.

## Props

### Filled and outlined variants

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectVariants.js"}}

### Labels and helper text

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectLabels.js"}}

### Auto width

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectAutoWidth.js"}}

### Other props

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/SelectOtherProps.js"}}

## Native select

As the user experience can be improved on mobile using the native select of the platform,
we allow such pattern.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/NativeSelect.js"}}

## TextField

The `TextField` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input and help text.
You can find an example with the select mode [in this section](/components/text-fields/#select).

## Customized selects

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

The first step is to style the `InputBase` component.
Once it's styled, you can either use it directly as a text field or provide it to the select `input` prop to have a `select` field.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/CustomizedSelects.js"}}

## Multiple select

The `Select` component can handle multiple selections.
It's enabled with the `multiple` prop.

Like with the single selection, you can pull out the new value by accessing `event.target.value` in the `onChange` callback. It's always an array.

### Default

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelect.js"}}

### Checkmarks

### Chip

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectChip.js"}}

### Placeholder

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/MultipleSelectPlaceholder.js"}}

### Native

## Controlled open select

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/ControlledOpenSelect.js"}}

## With a dialog

While it's discouraged by the Material Design specification, you can use a select inside a dialog.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/DialogSelect.js"}}

## Grouping

Display categories with the `ListSubheader` component or the native `<optgroup>` element.

{{"demo": "pages/components/selects/GroupedSelect.js"}}

## Accessibility

To properly label your `Select` input you need an extra element with an `id` that contains a label.
That `id` needs to match the `labelId` of the `Select` e.g.

```jsx
<InputLabel id="label">Age</InputLabel>
<Select labelId="label" id="select" value="20">
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</Select>
```

Alternatively a `TextField` with an `id` and `label` creates the proper markup and
ids for you:

```jsx
<TextField id="select" label="Age" value="20" select>
  <MenuItem value="10">Ten</MenuItem>
  <MenuItem value="20">Twenty</MenuItem>
</TextField>
```

For a [native select](#native-select), you should mention a label by giving the value of the `id` attribute of the select element to the `InputLabel`'s `htmlFor` attribute:

```jsx
<InputLabel htmlFor="select">Age</InputLabel>
<NativeSelect id="select">
  <option value="10">Ten</option>
  <option value="20">Twenty</option>
</NativeSelect>
```
