# Modal

<p class="description">模态框组件可以用来快速创建对话框、弹出窗口，灯箱等任何你所需的组件。</p>

The component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component. The `Modal` offers important features:

- 💄 Manages modal stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.
- 🔐 Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.
- 🔐 It disables scrolling of the page content while open.
- ♿️它妥善管理焦点;移动到模态内容， 并保持它直到模态关闭。
- ♿️自动添加适当的ARIA角色。
- 📦 [5 kB gzipped](/size-snapshot).

> **术语注释**。 “模态框”（Modal）这个词有时也被用来指代“对话框”，但是这种用法属于误用。 模态框的窗口可以描述用户界面的一部分。 如果一个元素[阻挡了用户与应用的其它部分的互动](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window)，这个元素就是模态的。

当你创建一个模态对话框时，使用[对话框（Dialog）](/components/dialogs/)组件比直接使用模态框更佳。 以下的组件将将模态框作为一个低级别的组件运用：

- [Dialog](/components/dialogs/)
- [Drawer](/components/drawers/)
- [Menu](/components/menus/)
- [Popover](/components/popover/)

## 简单的模态

Notice that you can disable the outline (often blue or gold) with the `outline: 0` CSS property.

## 过渡动画

The open/close state of the modal can be animated with a transition component. This component should respect the following conditions:

- Be a direct child descendent of the modal.
- Have an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open / close state.
- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.
- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed. These two callbacks allow the modal to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.

Modal has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).

Alternatively, you can use [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring).

## 性能

The content of the modal is **lazily mounted** into the DOM. It ensures that having many closed modals in your React tree won't slow down your page.

However, creating React elements has a cost too. Consider the following case:

```jsx
<Modal open={false}>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Dessert (100g serving)</td>
        <td>Calories</td>
        <td>Fat (g)</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {rows.map(row => (
        <tr key={row.id}>
          <th scope="row">
            {row.name}
          </th>
          <td>{row.calories}</td>
          <td>{row.fat}</TableCell>
        </tr>
      ))}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</Modal>
```

We create a lot of React elements that will never be mounted. It's wasteful 🐢. You can **speed up** the rendering by moving the modal body into its own component.

```jsx
<Modal open={false}>
  <TableComponent />
</Modal>
```

This way, you take advantage of [React render laziness evaluation](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/#lazy-evaluation). The `TableComponent` render method will only be evaluated when opening the modal.

## 可及性

- Be sure to add `aria-labelledby="id..."`, referencing the modal title, to the `Modal`. Additionally, you may give a description of your modal with the `aria-describedby="id..."` prop on the `Modal`.

```jsx
<Modal
  aria-labelledby="modal-title"
  aria-describedby="modal-description"
>
  <h2 id="modal-title">
    My Title
  </h2>
  <p id="modal-description">
    My Description
  </p>
</Modal>
```

- The [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) can help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element, based on your modal content.

## Server-side modal

React [doesn't support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13097) the [`createPortal()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) API on the server. In order to see the modal, you need to disable the portal feature with the `disablePortal` prop:
