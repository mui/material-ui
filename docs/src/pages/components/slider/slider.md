# Slider

<p class="description">Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.</p>

Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Continuous sliders

Continuous sliders allow users to select a value along a subjective range.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/ContinuousSlider.js"}}

## Sizes

For smaller slider, use the prop `size="small"`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/SliderSizes.js"}}

## Discrete sliders

Discrete sliders can be adjusted to a specific value by referencing its value indicator.
You can generate a mark for each step with `marks={true}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/DiscreteSlider.js"}}

### Small steps

You can change the default step increment.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/DiscreteSliderSteps.js"}}

### Custom marks

You can have custom marks by providing a rich array to the `marks` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/DiscreteSliderMarks.js"}}

### Restricted values

You can restrict the selectable values to those provided with the `marks` prop with `step={null}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/DiscreteSliderValues.js"}}

### Label always visible

You can force the thumb label to be always visible with `valueLabelDisplay="on"`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/DiscreteSliderLabel.js"}}

## Range slider

The slider can be used to set the start and end of a range by supplying an array of values to the `value` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/RangeSlider.js"}}

### Minimum distance

You can enforce a minimum distance between values in the `onChange` event handler.
By default, when you move the pointer over a thumb while dragging another thumb, the active thumb will swap to the hovered thumb. You can disable this behavior with the `disableSwap` prop.
If you want the range to shift when reaching minimum distance, you can utilize the `activeThumb` parameter in `onChange`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/MinimumDistanceSlider.js"}}

## Slider with input field

In this example, an input allows a discrete value to be set.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/InputSlider.js"}}

## Color

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/ColorSlider.js"}}

## Customization

Here are some examples of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/customization/how-to-customize/).

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/CustomizedSlider.js"}}

### Music player

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/MusicPlayerSlider.js"}}

## Vertical sliders

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/VerticalSlider.js"}}

**WARNING**: Chrome, Safari and newer Edge versions i.e. any browser based on WebKit exposes `<Slider orientation="vertical" />` as horizontal ([chromium issue #1158217](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1158217)).
By applying `-webkit-appearance: slider-vertical;` the slider is exposed as vertical.

However, by applying `-webkit-appearance: slider-vertical;` keyboard navigation for horizontal keys (<kbd class="key">Arrow Left</kbd>, <kbd class="key">Arrow Right</kbd>) is reversed ([chromium issue #1162640](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1162640)).
Usually, up and right should increase and left and down should decrease the value.
If you apply `-webkit-appearance` you could prevent keyboard navigation for horizontal arrow keys for a truly vertical slider.
This might be less confusing to users compared to a change in direction.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/VerticalAccessibleSlider.js"}}

## Track

The track shows the range available for user selection.

### Removed track

The track can be turned off with `track={false}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/TrackFalseSlider.js"}}

### Inverted track

The track can be inverted with `track="inverted"`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/TrackInvertedSlider.js"}}

## Non-linear scale

You can use the `scale` prop to represent the `value` on a different scale.

In the following demo, the value _x_ represents the value _2^x_.
Increasing _x_ by one increases the represented value by factor _2_.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/NonLinearSlider.js"}}

## Unstyled

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

- 📦 [5.6 kB gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@mui/base@latest)

The slider also comes with an unstyled version.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

```js
import SliderUnstyled from '@mui/base/SliderUnstyled';
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/UnstyledSlider.js"}}

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#slider)

The component handles most of the work necessary to make it accessible.
However, you need to make sure that:

- Each thumb has a user-friendly label (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `getAriaLabel` prop).
- Each thumb has a user-friendly text for its current value.
  This is not required if the value matches the semantics of the label.
  You can change the name with the `getAriaValueText` or `aria-valuetext` prop.

## Limitations

### IE 11

The slider's value label is not centered in IE 11.
The alignement is not handled to make customizations easier with the lastest browsers.
You can solve the issue with:

```css
.MuiSlider-valueLabel {
  left: calc(-50% - 4px);
}
```
