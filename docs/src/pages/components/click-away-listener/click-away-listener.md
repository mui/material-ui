# Click away listener

<p class="description">Detect if a click event happened outside of an element. It listens for clicks that occur somewhere in the document.</p>

- ⚛️ Support portals

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Example

For instance, if you need to hide a menu dropdown when people click anywhere else on your page:

{{"demo": "pages/components/click-away-listener/ClickAway.js"}}

Notice that the component only accepts one child element.
You can find a more advanced demo on the [Menu documentation section](/components/menus/#menulist-composition).

## Portal

The following demo uses [`Portal`](/components/portal/) to render the dropdown into a new "subtree" outside of current DOM hierarchy.

{{"demo": "pages/components/click-away-listener/PortalClickAway.js"}}

## Leading edge

By default, the component responds to the trailing events (click + touch end).
However, you can configure it to respond to the leading events (mouse down + touch start).

{{"demo": "pages/components/click-away-listener/LeadingClickAway.js"}}

> ⚠️ In this mode, only interactions on the scrollbar of the document is ignored.

## Unstyled

- 📦 [784 B gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@mui/base@latest)

As the component does not have any styles, it also comes with the unstyled package.

```js
import ClickAwayListener from '@mui/base/ClickAwayListener';
```
