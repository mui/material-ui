# Stepper

<p class="description">Steppers convey progress through numbered steps. It provides a wizard-like workflow.</p>

[Steppers](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/steppers.html) display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps. They may also be used for navigation. Steppers may display a transient feedback message after a step is saved.

- **Types of Steps**: Editable, Non-editable, Mobile, Optional
- **Types of Steppers**: Horizontal, Vertical, Linear, Non-linear

> **Note:** Steppers are no longer documented in the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/), but Material-UI will continue to support them.

## Horizontal Stepper

Horizontal steppers are ideal when the contents of one step depend on an earlier step.

{{"demo": "pages/components/steppers/HorizontalLinearStepper.js", "bg": true}}

### Linear

A linear stepper allows the user to complete the steps in sequence.

The `Stepper` can be controlled by passing the current step index (zero-based) as the `activeStep` property. `Stepper` orientation is set using the `orientation` property.

This example also shows the use of an optional step by placing the `optional` property on the second `Step` component. Note that it's up to you to manage when an optional step is skipped. Once you've determined this for a particular step you must set `completed={false}` to signify that even though the active step index has gone beyond the optional step, it's not actually complete.

### Non-linear

Non-linear steppers allow users to enter a multi-step flow at any point.

This example is similar to the regular horizontal stepper, except steps are no longer automatically set to `disabled={true}` based on the `activeStep` property.

The use of the `StepButton` here demonstrates clickable step labels, as well as setting the `completed` flag. However because steps can be accessed in a non-linear fashion, it's up to your own implementation to determine when all steps are completed (or even if they need to be completed).

### Customized Stepper

Labels can be placed below the step icon by setting the `alternativeLabel` prop on the `Stepper` component.

### Non-linear - Error Step

### Non-linear - Alternative Label

## Vertical Stepper

Vertical steppers are designed for narrow screen sizes. They are ideal for mobile. All the features of the horizontal stepper can be implemented.

{{"demo": "pages/components/steppers/VerticalLinearStepper.js"}}

## Mobile Stepper

This component implements a compact stepper suitable for a mobile device. IT has more limited functionality than the vertical stepper. See [mobile steps](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/steppers.html#steppers-types-of-steps) for its inspiration.

The mobile stepper supports three variants to display progress through the available steps: text, dots, and progress.

### Text

Use dots when the number of steps isn’t large.

{{"demo": "pages/components/steppers/TextMobileStepper.js", "bg": true}}

### Text with Carousel effect

This demo is very similar to the previous, the difference is the usage of [react-swipeable-views](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views) to make the transition of steps.

{{"demo": "pages/components/steppers/SwipeableTextMobileStepper.js", "bg": true}}

### Dots

Use dots when the number of steps is small.

{{"demo": "pages/components/steppers/DotsMobileStepper.js", "bg": true}}

### Прогресс

Use a progress bar when there are many steps, or if there are steps that need to be inserted during the process (based on responses to earlier steps).
