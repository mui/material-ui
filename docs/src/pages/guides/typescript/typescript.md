# TypeScript

<p class="description">You can add static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality thanks to TypeScript.</p>

Material-UI requires a minimum version of TypeScript 3.2.

Have a look at the [Create React App with TypeScript](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript) example.

In order for types to work, you have to at least have the following options enabled
in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

The strict mode options are the same that are required for every types package
published in the `@types/` namespace. Using a less strict `tsconfig.json` or omitting some of the libraries might cause errors. To get the best type experience with the types we recommend
setting `"strict": true`.

## Usage of `withStyles`

Using `withStyles` in TypeScript can be a little tricky, but there are some utilities to make the experience as painless as possible.

### Using `createStyles` to defeat type widening

A frequent source of confusion is TypeScript's [type widening](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/typescript-2-1-literal-type-widening), which causes this example not to work as expected:

```ts
const styles = {
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
  }
};

withStyles(styles);
//         ^^^^^^
//         Types of property 'flexDirection' are incompatible.
//           Type 'string' is not assignable to type '"-moz-initial" | "inherit" | "initial" | "revert" | "unset" | "column" | "column-reverse" | "row"...'.
```

The problem is that the type of the `flexDirection` property is inferred as `string`, which is too arbitrary. To fix this, you can pass the styles object directly to `withStyles`:

```ts
withStyles({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
  },
});
```

However type widening rears its ugly head once more if you try to make the styles depend on the theme:

```ts
withStyles(({ palette, spacing }) => ({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    padding: spacing.unit,
    backgroundColor: palette.background.default,
    color: palette.primary.main,
  },
}));
```

This is because TypeScript [widens the return types of function expressions](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/241).

Because of this, using the `createStyles` helper function to construct your style rules object is recommended:

```ts
// Non-dependent styles
const styles = createStyles({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
  },
});

// Theme-dependent styles
const styles = ({ palette, spacing }: Theme) => createStyles({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    padding: spacing.unit,
    backgroundColor: palette.background.default,
    color: palette.primary.main,
  },
});
```

`createStyles` is just the identity function; it doesn't "do anything" at runtime, just helps guide type inference at compile time.

### Media queries

`withStyles` allows a styles object with top level media-queries like so:

```ts
const styles = createStyles({
  root: {
    minHeight: '100vh',
  },
  '@media (min-width: 960px)': {
    root: {
      display: 'flex',
    },
  },
});
```

However to allow these styles to pass TypeScript, the definitions have to be ambiguous concerning names for CSS classes and actual CSS property names. Due to this class names that are equal to CSS properties should be avoided.

```ts
// error because TypeScript thinks `@media (min-width: 960px)` is a class name
// and `content` is the css property
const ambiguousStyles = createStyles({
  content: {
    minHeight: '100vh',
  },
  '@media (min-width: 960px)': {
    content: {
      display: 'flex',
    },
  },
});

// works just fine
const ambiguousStyles = createStyles({
  contentClass: {
    minHeight: '100vh',
  },
  '@media (min-width: 960px)': {
    contentClass: {
      display: 'flex',
    },
  },
});
```

### Augmenting your props using `WithStyles`

Since a component decorated with `withStyles(styles)` gets a special `classes` prop injected, you will want to define its props accordingly:

```ts
const styles = (theme: Theme) => createStyles({
  root: { /* ... */ },
  paper: { /* ... */ },
  button: { /* ... */ },
});

interface Props {
  // non-style props
  foo: number;
  bar: boolean;
  // injected style props
  classes: {
    root: string;
    paper: string;
    button: string;
  };
}
```

However this isn't very [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) because it requires you to maintain the class names (`'root'`, `'paper'`, `'button'`, ...) in two different places. We provide a type operator `WithStyles` to help with this, so that you can just write:

```ts
import { WithStyles, createStyles } from '@material-ui/core';

const styles = (theme: Theme) => createStyles({
  root: { /* ... */ },
  paper: { /* ... */ },
  button: { /* ... */ },
});

interface Props extends WithStyles<typeof styles> {
  foo: number;
  bar: boolean;
}
```

### Decorating components

Applying `withStyles(styles)` as a function works as expected:

```tsx
const DecoratedSFC = withStyles(styles)(({ text, type, color, classes }: Props) => (
  <Typography variant={type} color={color} classes={classes}>
    {text}
  </Typography>
));

const DecoratedClass = withStyles(styles)(
  class extends React.Component<Props> {
    render() {
      const { text, type, color, classes } = this.props
      return (
        <Typography variant={type} color={color} classes={classes}>
          {text}
        </Typography>
      );
    }
  }
);
```

Unfortunately due to a [current limitation of TypeScript decorators](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/4881), `withStyles(styles)` can't be used as a decorator in TypeScript.

## Customization of `Theme`

When adding custom properties to the `Theme`, you may continue to use it in a strongly typed way by exploiting
[TypeScript's module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).

The following example adds an `appDrawer` property that is merged into the one exported by `material-ui`:

```ts
import { Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles/createMuiTheme';
import { Breakpoint } from '@material-ui/core/styles/createBreakpoints';

declare module '@material-ui/core/styles/createMuiTheme' {
  interface Theme {
    appDrawer: {
      width: React.CSSProperties['width']
      breakpoint: Breakpoint
    }
  }
  // allow configuration using `createMuiTheme`
  interface ThemeOptions {
    appDrawer?: {
      width?: React.CSSProperties['width']
      breakpoint?: Breakpoint
    }
  }
}
```

And a custom theme factory with additional defaulted options:

**./styles/createMyTheme**:
```ts
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeOptions } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

export default function createMyTheme(options: ThemeOptions) {
  return createMuiTheme({
    appDrawer: {
      width: 225,
      breakpoint: 'lg',
    },
    ...options,
  })
}
```

This could be used like:

```ts
import createMyTheme from './styles/createMyTheme';

const theme = createMyTheme({ appDrawer: { breakpoint: 'md' }});
```

## Usage of `component` prop

Many Material-UI components allow you to replace their root node via a `component`
prop, this will be detailed in the component's API documentation.
For example, a Button's root node can be replaced with a React Router's Link, and any additional props that are passed to Button, such as `to`, will be spread to the Link component.
For a code example concerning Button and react-router-dom checkout [these demos](/guides/composition/#routing-libraries).

To be able to use props of such a Material-UI component on their own, props should be used with type arguments. Otherwise, the `component` prop will not be present in the props of the Material-UI component.

The examples below use `TypographyProps` but the same will work for any component which has props defined with `OverrideProps`.

The following `CustomComponent` component has the same props as the `Typography` component.

```ts
function CustomComponent(props: TypographyProps<'a', { component: 'a' }>) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Now the `CustomComponent` can be used with a `component` prop which should be set to `'a'`. In addition, the `CustomComponent` will have all props of a `<a>` HTML element. The other props of the `Typography` component will also be present in props of the `CustomComponent`.

It is possible to have generic `CustomComponent` which will accept any React component, custom and HTML elements.

```ts
function GenericCustomComponent<C extends React.ElementType>(
  props: TypographyProps<C, { component?: C }>,
) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Now if the `GenericCustomComponent` will be used with a `component` prop provided, it should also have all props required by the provided component.

```ts
function ThirdPartyComponent({ prop1 } : { prop1: string }) {
  return <div />
}
// ...
<GenericCustomComponent component={ThirdPartyComponent} prop1="some value" />;
```

The `prop1` became required for the `GenericCustomComponent` as the `ThirdPartyComponent` has it as a requirement.

Not every component fully supports any component type you pass in. If you encounter a component that rejects its `component` props in TypeScript please open an issue.
There is an ongoing effort to fix this by making component props generic.

## Handling `value` and event handlers

Many components concerned with user input offer a `value` prop or event handlers
which include the current `value`. In most situations that `value` is only handled
within React which allows it be of any type, such as objects or arrays.

However, that type cannot be verified at compile time in situations where it depends
on the component's children e.g. for `Select` or `RadioGroup`. This means that
the soundest option is to type it as `unknown` and let the developer decide
how they want to narrow that type down. We do not offer the possibility to use a generic
type in those cases for [the same reasons `event.target` is not generic in React](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/11508#issuecomment-256045682).

The demos include typed variants that use type casting. It is an acceptable tradeoff
because the types are all located in a single file and are very basic. You have to decide for yourself
if the same tradeoff is acceptable for you. The library types are be strict
by default and loose via opt-in.
