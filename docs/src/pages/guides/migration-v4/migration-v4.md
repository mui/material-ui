# Migration from v4 to v5

<p class="description">Yeah, v5 has been released!</p>

If you're looking for the v4 docs, you can [find them here](https://material-ui.com/versions/).

## Introduction

This is a reference for upgrading your site from Material-UI v4 to v5.
While there's a lot covered here, you probably won't need to do everything.
We'll do our best to keep things easy to follow, and as sequential as possible, so you can quickly get rocking on v5!

## Why you should migrate

This documentation page covers the _how_ of migrating from v4 to v5.
The _why_ will be covered in an upcoming blog post on Medium.

## Migration Steps

> 💡 Prefer to create small commits on any changes to help the migration goes smoother.
> If you encounter any issue, check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. For other unknown error, [create an issue](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=status%3A+needs+triage&template=1.bug.md) with this title format `[Migration] Summary of your issue`.

## Update React & TypeScript version

- The minimum supported version of **React** was increased from v16.8.0 to v17.0.0.
- The minimum supported version of **TypeScript** was increased from v3.2 to v3.5.

  > We try to align with types released from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) (i.e. packages published on npm under the `@types` namespace).
  > We will not change the minimum supported version in a major version of Material-UI.
  > However, we generally recommend to not use a TypeScript version older than the [lowest supported version of DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#older-versions-of-typescript-33-and-earlier)

**Note:** if your project includes these packages, please upgrade them to the `latest` version.

- `react-scripts`
- `@types/react`
- `@types/react-dom`

> 📝 Please make sure that your application is still **running** without error and **commit** the change before continuing the next step.

## `ThemeProvider` setup

Make sure that `ThemeProvider` is defined at the root of your application (even if you are using the **default theme**) and **NO** `useStyles` is called before `<ThemeProvider>`. This is because we are going to use `@material-ui/styles` temporarily which require `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import { ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme, makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createMuiTheme();

const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => {
  root: {
    // some css that access to theme
  }
});

function App() {
  const classes = useStyles(); // ❌ If you have this, consider moving <ThemeProvider> to HOC and wrap the App
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

> 📝 Please make sure that your application is still **running** without error and **commit** the change before continuing the next step.

## Update Material-UI version

To use the `next` version of Material-UI.

> 💡 If you want to use Material-UI v5 with **styled-components** instead of emotion, check out [the installation guide](/getting-started/installation/#npm)

```sh
npm install @material-ui/core@next @emotion/react @emotion/styled

// or with `yarn`
yarn add @material-ui/core@next @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

**Optional** if your project includes `@material-ui/icons` and/or `@material-ui/lab`, use the `next` version of them.

```sh
npm install @material-ui/icons@next @material-ui/lab@next

// or with `yarn`
yarn add @material-ui/icons@next @material-ui/lab@next
```

> **Note:** if you are using `@material-ui/pickers`, it has moved to `@material-ui/lab`. The details is in "Handling breaking changes" section.

In this migration process, you will need to install/update `@material-ui/styles` (JSS) for temporary transition to v5.

```sh
npm install @material-ui/styles@next

// or with `yarn`
yarn add @material-ui/styles@next
```

> ⚠️ After this step, your application is expected to crash because the style library has changed from **JSS (v4)** to **emotion (v5)**.

## Run codemods

We have prepared these codemods to ease your migration experience.

### preset-safe

This codemod contains most of the transformers that are useful for migration. (**This codemod should be applied only once per folder**)

```sh
npx @material-ui/codemod@next v5.0.0/preset-safe <folder>
```

> If you want to run the transformers one by one, check out [preset-safe codemod](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/next/packages/material-ui-codemod/README.md#-preset-safe) for more details.

### variant-prop

Transform `<TextField/>, <FormControl/>, <Select/>` component by applying `variant="standard"` if no variant is defined (because default variant has changed from `standard` in **v4** to `outlined` in **v5**).

> ❗️ You should **NOT** use this codemod if you have already defined default `variant: "outlined"` in the theme.

```js
// if you have theme setup like this, ❌ don't run this codemod.
// these default props can be removed later because `outlined` is the default value in v5
createMuiTheme({
  props: {
    MuiTextField: {
      variant: 'outlined',
    },
  },
});
```

However, if you want to keep `variant="standard"` to you components, run this codemod or configure theme default props.

```sh
npx @material-ui/codemod@next v5.0.0/variant-prop <folder>
```

> For more details, checkout [variant-prop codemod](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/next/packages/material-ui-codemod/README.md#variant-prop)

### link-underline-hover

Transform `<Link/>` component by apply `underline="hover"` if no `underline` prop defined (because default `underline` has changed from `"hover"` in **v4** to `"always"` in **v5**).

> ❗️ You should **NOT** use this codemod if you already define default `underline: "always"` in the theme.

```js
// if you have theme setup like this, ❌ don't run this codemod.
// this default props can be removed later because `always` is the default value in v5
createMuiTheme({
  props: {
    MuiLink: {
      underline: 'always',
    },
  },
});
```

However, if you want to keep `variant="hover"` to you components, run this codemod or configure theme default props.

```sh
npx @material-ui/codemod@next v5.0.0/link-underline-hover <folder>
```

> For more details, checkout [link-underline-hover codemod](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/next/packages/material-ui-codemod/README.md#link-underline-hover)

Once you have completed the codemod step, try running your application again. At this point, it should be running without error. Otherwise check out the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. Next step, handling breaking changes in each component.

## Handling breaking changes

### Supported browsers and node versions

The targets of the default bundle have changed.
The exact versions will be pinned on release from the browserslist query `"> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead, not IE 11, maintained node versions"`.

The default bundle supports the following minimum versions:

<!-- #stable-snapshot -->

- Node 12 (up from 8)
- Chrome 84 (up from 49)
- Edge 85 (up from 14)
- Firefox 78 (up from 52)
- Safari 13 (macOS) and 12.2 (iOS) (up from 10)
- and more (see [.browserslistrc (`stable` entry)](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/HEAD/.browserslistrc#L11))

It no longer supports IE 11.
If you need to support IE 11, check out our [legacy bundle](/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#legacy-bundle).

### non-ref-forwarding class components

Support for non-ref-forwarding class components in the `component` prop or as immediate `children` has been dropped. If you were using `unstable_createStrictModeTheme` or didn't see any warnings related to `findDOMNode` in `React.StrictMode` then you don't need to do anything.
Otherwise check out the [Caveat with refs](/guides/composition/#caveat-with-refs) section in the composition guide to find out how to migrate.
This change affects almost all components where you're using the `component` prop or passing `children` to components that require `children` to be elements (e.g. `<MenuList><CustomMenuItem /></MenuList>`)

### Style library

The style library used by default in v5 is [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion). While migrating from JSS to emotion, and if you are using JSS style overrides for your components (for example overrides created by `makeStyles`), you will need to take care of the CSS injection order. To do so, you need to have the `StyledEngineProvider` with the `injectFirst` option at the **top of your component tree**.

> ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

Here is an example:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { StyledEngineProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

export default function GlobalCssPriority() {
  return (
    {/* Inject emotion before JSS */}
    <StyledEngineProvider injectFirst>
      {/* Your component tree. Now you can override Material-UI's styles. */}
    </StyledEngineProvider>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** If you are using emotion to style your app, and have a custom cache, it will override the one provided by Material-UI. In order for the injection order to still be correct, you need to add the `prepend` option to `createCache`.
>
> ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

Here is an example:

```diff
import * as React from 'react';
import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import createCache from '@emotion/cache';

const cache = createCache({
  key: 'css',
+ prepend: true,
});

export default function PlainCssPriority() {
  return (
    <CacheProvider value={cache}>
      {/* Your component tree. Now you can override Material-UI's styles. */}
    </CacheProvider>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** If you are using styled-components and have `StyleSheetManager` with a custom `target`, make sure that the target is the first element in the HTML `<head>`. To see how it can be done, take a look at the [`StyledEngineProvider` implementation](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/next/packages/material-ui-styled-engine-sc/src/StyledEngineProvider/StyledEngineProvider.js) in the `@material-ui/styled-engine-sc` package.

### Theme

- The `MuiThemeProvider` component is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. Use `ThemeProvider` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { MuiThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  ```

- The function `createMuiTheme` was renamed to `createTheme` to make it more intuitive to use with `ThemeProvider`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  -const theme = createMuiTheme({
  +const theme = createTheme({
  ```

- The `theme.breakpoints.width` utility was removed because it's redundant. Use `theme.breakpoints.values` to get the same values.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -theme.breakpoints.width('md')
  +theme.breakpoints.values.md
  ```

- The signature of `theme.palette.augmentColor` helper has changed:

  ```diff
  -theme.palette.augmentColor(red);
  +theme.palette.augmentColor({ color: red, name: 'brand' });
  ```

- The `theme.typography.round` helper was removed because it was no longer used. If you need it, use the function below:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```js
  function round(value) {
    return Math.round(value * 1e5) / 1e5;
  }
  ```

#### Upgrade helper

For a smoother transition, the `adaptV4Theme` helper allows you to iteratively upgrade some of the theme changes to the new theme structure.

> ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

```diff
-import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
+import { createTheme, adaptV4Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

-const theme = createMuiTheme({
+const theme = createTheme(adaptV4Theme({
   // v4 theme
-});
+}));
```

##### Supported changes

The following changes are supported by the adapter:

- The "gutters" abstraction hasn't proven to be used frequently enough to be valuable.

  ```diff
  -theme.mixins.gutters(),
  +paddingLeft: theme.spacing(2),
  +paddingRight: theme.spacing(2),
  +[theme.breakpoints.up('sm')]: {
  +  paddingLeft: theme.spacing(3),
  +  paddingRight: theme.spacing(3),
  +},
  ```

- `theme.spacing` now returns single values with px units by default.
  This change improves the integration with styled-components & emotion.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe) by removing any 'px' suffix from `theme.spacing` calls in a template string.

  Before:

  ```js
  theme.spacing(2) => 16
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  theme.spacing(2) => '16px'
  ```

- The `theme.palette.type` key was renamed to `theme.palette.mode`, to better follow the "dark mode" term that is usually used for describing this feature.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  -const theme = createTheme({palette: { type: 'dark' }}),
  +const theme = createTheme({palette: { mode: 'dark' }}),
  ```

- The default `theme.palette.info` colors was changed to pass AA standard contrast ratio in both light & dark mode.

  ```diff
   info = {
  -  main: cyan[500],
  +  main: lightBlue[700], // lightBlue[400] in "dark" mode

  -  light: cyan[300],
  +  light: lightBlue[500], // lightBlue[300] in "dark" mode

  -  dark: cyan[700],
  +  dark: lightBlue[900], // lightBlue[700] in "dark" mode
   }
  ```

- The default `theme.palette.success` colors was changed to pass AA standard contrast ratio in both light & dark mode.

  ```diff
   success = {
  -  main: green[500],
  +  main: green[800], // green[400] in "dark" mode

  -  light: green[300],
  +  light: green[500], // green[300] in "dark" mode

  -  dark: green[700],
  +  dark: green[900], // green[700] in "dark" mode
   }
  ```

- The default `theme.palette.warning` colors was changed to pass AA standard contrast ratio in both light & dark mode.

  ```diff
   warning = {
  -  main: orange[500],
  +  main: "#ED6C02", // orange[400] in "dark" mode

  -  light: orange[300],
  +  light: orange[500], // orange[300] in "dark" mode

  -  dark: orange[700],
  +  dark: orange[900], // orange[700] in "dark" mode
   }
  ```

- The `theme.palette.text.hint` key was unused in Material-UI components, and has been removed.
  If you depend on it, you can add it back:

  ```diff
   import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  -const theme = createTheme(),
  +const theme = createTheme({
  +  palette: { text: { hint: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.38)' } },
  +});
  ```

- The components' definitions in the theme were restructure under the `components` key, to allow for easier discoverability of the definitions related to any one component.

1. `props`

```diff
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
-  props: {
-    MuiButton: {
-      disableRipple: true,
-    },
-  },
+  components: {
+    MuiButton: {
+      defaultProps: {
+        disableRipple: true,
+      },
+    },
+  },
});
```

2. `overrides`

```diff
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
-  overrides: {
-    MuiButton: {
-      root: { padding: 0 },
-    },
-  },
+  components: {
+    MuiButton: {
+      styleOverrides: {
+        root: { padding: 0 },
+      },
+    },
+  },
});
```

### Styles

- Renamed `fade` to `alpha` to better describe its functionality.
  The previous name was leading to confusion when the input color already had an alpha value. The helper **overrides** the alpha value of the color.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  - import { fade } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  + import { alpha } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  const classes = makeStyles(theme => ({
  -  backgroundColor: fade(theme.palette.primary.main, theme.palette.action.selectedOpacity),
  +  backgroundColor: alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, theme.palette.action.selectedOpacity),
  }));
  ```

- The `createStyles` function from `@material-ui/core/styles` was moved to the one exported from `@material-ui/styles`. It is necessary for removing the dependency to `@material-ui/styles` in the core package.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { createStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { createStyles } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

### @material-ui/styles

#### ThemeProvider

If you are using the utilities from `@material-ui/styles` together with the `@material-ui/core`, you should replace the use of `ThemeProvider` from `@material-ui/styles` with the one exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. This way, the `theme` provided in the context will be available in both the styling utilities exported from `@material-ui/styles`, like `makeStyles`, `withStyles` etc. and the Material-UI components.

```diff
-import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/styles';
+import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
```

Make sure to add a `ThemeProvider` at the root of your application, as the `defaultTheme` is no longer available.

#### Default theme (TypeScript)

The `@material-ui/styles` package is no longer part of `@material-ui/core/styles`. If you are using `@material-ui/styles` together with `@material-ui/core` you need to add a module augmentation for the `DefaultTheme`.

> ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

```ts
// in your theme file that you call `createTheme()`
import { Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

declare module '@material-ui/styles' {
  interface DefaultTheme extends Theme {}
}
```

### @material-ui/core/styles

#### createGenerateClassName

- The `createGenerateClassName` function is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You should import it directly from `@material-ui/styles`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { createGenerateClassName } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { createGenerateClassName } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

#### jssPreset

- The `jssPreset` object is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You should import it directly from `@material-ui/styles`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { jssPreset } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { jssPreset } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

#### makeStyles

- The `makeStyles` JSS utility is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You can use `@material-ui/styles/makeStyles` instead. Make sure to add a `ThemeProvider` at the root of your application, as the `defaultTheme` is no longer available. If you are using this utility together with `@material-ui/core`, it's recommended that you use the `ThemeProvider` component from `@material-ui/core/styles` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/styles';
  +import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  +const theme = createTheme();
   const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
     background: theme.palette.primary.main,
   }));
   function Component() {
     const classes = useStyles();
     return <div className={classes.root} />
   }

   // In the root of your app
   function App(props) {
  -  return <Component />;
  +  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}><Component {...props} /></ThemeProvider>;
   }
  ```

#### ServerStyleSheets

- The `ServerStyleSheets` component is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You should import it directly from `@material-ui/styles`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { ServerStyleSheets } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { ServerStyleSheets } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

#### styled

- The `styled` JSS utility is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You can use `@material-ui/styles/styled` instead. Make sure to add a `ThemeProvider` at the root of your application, as the `defaultTheme` is no longer available. If you are using this utility together with `@material-ui/core`, it's recommended you use the `ThemeProvider` component from `@material-ui/core/styles` instead.

  ```diff
  -import { styled } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { styled } from '@material-ui/styles';
  +import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  +const theme = createTheme();
   const MyComponent = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({ background: theme.palette.primary.main }));

   function App(props) {
  -  return <MyComponent />;
  +  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}><MyComponent {...props} /></ThemeProvider>;
   }
  ```

#### StylesProvider

- The `StylesProvider` component is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You should import it directly from `@material-ui/styles`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { StylesProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { StylesProvider } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

#### useThemeVariants

- The `useThemeVariants` hook is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You should import it directly from `@material-ui/styles`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { useThemeVariants } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { useThemeVariants } from '@material-ui/styles';
  ```

#### withStyles

- Replace the `innerRef` prop with the `ref` prop. Refs are now automatically forwarded to the inner component.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   import * as React from 'react';
   import { withStyles } from '@material-ui/styles';

   const MyComponent = withStyles({
     root: {
       backgroundColor: 'red',
     },
   })(({ classes }) => <div className={classes.root} />);

   function MyOtherComponent(props) {
     const ref = React.useRef();
  -  return <MyComponent innerRef={ref} />;
  +  return <MyComponent ref={ref} />;
   }
  ```

- The `withStyles` JSS utility is no longer exported from `@material-ui/core/styles`. You can use `@material-ui/styles/withStyles` instead. Make sure to add a `ThemeProvider` at the root of your application, as the `defaultTheme` is no longer available. If you are using this utility together with `@material-ui/core`, you should use the `ThemeProvider` component from `@material-ui/core/styles` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { withStyles } from '@material-ui/styles';
  +import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  +const defaultTheme = createTheme();
   const MyComponent = withStyles((props) => {
     const { classes, className, ...other } = props;
     return <div className={clsx(className, classes.root)} {...other} />
   })(({ theme }) => ({ root: { background: theme.palette.primary.main }}));

   function App() {
  -  return <MyComponent />;
  +  return <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}><MyComponent /></ThemeProvider>;
   }
  ```

#### withTheme

- The `withTheme` HOC utility has been removed from the `@material-ui/core/styles` package. You can use `@material-ui/styles/withTheme` instead. Make sure to add a `ThemeProvider` at the root of your application, as the `defaultTheme` is no longer available. If you are using this utility together with `@material-ui/core`, it's recommended you use the `ThemeProvider` component from `@material-ui/core/styles` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import { withTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
  +import { withTheme } from '@material-ui/styles';
  +import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  +const theme = createTheme();
   const MyComponent = withTheme(({ theme }) => <div>{props.theme.direction}</div>);

   function App(props) {
  -  return <MyComponent />;
  +  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}><MyComponent {...props} /></ThemeProvider>;
   }
  ```

- Replace the `innerRef` prop with the `ref` prop. Refs are now automatically forwarded to the inner component.

  ```diff
  import * as React from 'react';
  import { withTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  const MyComponent = withTheme(({ theme }) => <div>{props.theme.direction}</div>);

  function MyOtherComponent(props) {
    const ref = React.useRef();
  - return <MyComponent innerRef={ref} />;
  + return <MyComponent ref={ref} />;
  }
  ```

#### withWidth

- This HOC was removed. There's an alternative using the [`useMediaQuery` hook](/components/use-media-query/#migrating-from-withwidth).

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe) by applying hard-coded function to prevent the application from crashing.

### @material-ui/pickers

We have a [dedicated page](/guides/pickers-migration/) for migrating `@material-ui/pickers` to v5

### System

- The following system functions (and properties) were renamed because they are considered deprecated CSS:

  - `gridGap` to `gap`
  - `gridRowGap` to `rowGap`
  - `gridColumnGap` to `columnGap`

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

- Use spacing unit in `gap`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap`. If you were using a number previously, you need to mention the px to bypass the new transformation with `theme.spacing`.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Box
  -  gap={2}
  +  gap="2px"

- Replace `css` prop with `sx` to avoid collision with styled-components & emotion `css` prop.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Box css={{ color: 'primary.main' }} />
  +<Box sx={{ color: 'primary.main' }} />
  ```

  > Note that the system grid function wasn't documented in v4.

### Core components

As the core components use emotion as their style engine, the props used by emotion are not intercepted. The prop `as` in the following code snippet will not be propagated to `SomeOtherComponent`.

```jsx
<MuiComponent component={SomeOtherComponent} as="button" />
```

### AppBar

- Remove z-index when position static and relative. This avoids the creation of a stacking context and rendering issues.
- The `color` prop has no longer any effect in dark mode. The app bar uses the background color required by the elevation to follow the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html). Use `enableColorOnDark` to restore the behavior of v4.

  ```jsx
  <AppBar enableColorOnDark />
  ```

### Alert

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import Alert from '@material-ui/lab/Alert';
  -import AlertTitle from '@material-ui/lab/AlertTitle';
  +import Alert from '@material-ui/core/Alert';
  +import AlertTitle from '@material-ui/core/AlertTitle';
  ```

### Autocomplete

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import Autocomplete from '@material-ui/lab/Autocomplete';
  -import useAutocomplete  from '@material-ui/lab/useAutocomplete';
  +import Autocomplete from '@material-ui/core/Autocomplete';
  +import useAutoComplete from '@material-ui/core/useAutocomplete';
  ```

- Remove `debug` prop. There are a couple of simpler alternatives: `open={true}`, Chrome devtools ["Emulate focused"](https://twitter.com/sulco/status/1305841873945272321), or React devtools prop setter.
- `renderOption` should now return the full DOM structure of the option.
  It makes customizations easier. You can recover from the change with:

  ```diff
   <Autocomplete
  -  renderOption={(option, { selected }) => (
  -    <React.Fragment>
  +  renderOption={(props, option, { selected }) => (
  +    <li {...props}>
         <Checkbox
           icon={icon}
           checkedIcon={checkedIcon}
           style={{ marginRight: 8 }}
           checked={selected}
         />
         {option.title}
  -    </React.Fragment>
  +    </li>
     )}
   />
  ```

- Rename `closeIcon` prop to `clearIcon` to avoid confusion.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Autocomplete closeIcon={defaultClearIcon} />
  +<Autocomplete clearIcon={defaultClearIcon} />
  ```

- The following values of the reason argument in `onChange` and `onClose` were renamed for consistency:

  1. `create-option` to `createOption`
  2. `select-option` to `selectOption`
  3. `remove-option` to `removeOption`

- Change the CSS rules that use `[data-focus="true"]` to use `.Mui-focused`. The `data-focus` attribute is not set on the focused option anymore, instead, global class names are used.

  ```diff
  -'.MuiAutocomplete-option[data-focus="true"]': {
  +'.MuiAutocomplete-option.Mui-focused': {
  ```

- Rename `getOptionSelected` to `isOptionEqualToValue` to better describe its purpose.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Autocomplete
  -  getOptionSelected={(option, value) => option.title === value.title}
  +  isOptionEqualToValue={(option, value) => option.title === value.title}
  ```

### Avatar

- Rename `circle` to `circular` for consistency:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Avatar variant="circle">
  -<Avatar classes={{ circle: 'className' }}>
  +<Avatar variant="circular">
  +<Avatar classes={{ circular: 'className' }}>
  ```

  Since `circular` is the default value, the variant prop can be deleted:

  ```diff
  -<Avatar variant="circle">
  +<Avatar>
  ```

- Move the AvatarGroup from the lab to the core.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import AvatarGroup from '@material-ui/lab/AvatarGroup';
  +import AvatarGroup from '@material-ui/core/AvatarGroup';
  ```

### Badge

- Rename `circle` to `circular` and `rectangle` to `rectangular` for consistency.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Badge overlap="circle">
  -<Badge overlap="rectangle">
  +<Badge overlap="circular">
  +<Badge overlap="rectangular">
  ```

  ```diff
   <Badge classes={{
  -  anchorOriginTopRightRectangle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginBottomRightRectangle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginTopLeftRectangle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginBottomLeftRectangle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginTopRightCircle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginBottomRightCircle: 'className',
  -  anchorOriginTopLeftCircle: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginTopRightRectangular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginBottomRightRectangular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginTopLeftRectangular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginBottomLeftRectangular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginTopRightCircular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginBottomRightCircular: 'className',
  +  anchorOriginTopLeftCircular: 'className',
   }}>
  ```

### BottomNavigation

- TypeScript: The `event` in `onChange` is no longer typed as a `React.ChangeEvent` but `React.SyntheticEvent`.

  ```diff
  -<BottomNavigation onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<{}>) => {}} />
  +<BottomNavigation onChange={(event: React.SyntheticEvent) => {}} />
  ```

### BottomNavigationAction

- Remove the `span` element that wraps the children. Remove the `wrapper` classKey too. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/26923).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiBottomNavigationAction-root">
  -  <span class="MuiBottomNavigationAction-wrapper">
       {icon}
       <span class="MuiBottomNavigationAction-label">
         {label}
       </span>
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### Box

- The `borderRadius` system prop value transformation has been changed. If it receives a number, it multiplies this value with the `theme.shape.borderRadius` value. Use a string to provide an explicit `px` value.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Box borderRadius="borderRadius">
  +<Box borderRadius={1}>
  ```

  ```diff
  -<Box borderRadius={16}>
  +<Box borderRadius="16px">
  ```

- The Box system props have an optional alternative API in v5, using the `sx` prop. You can [read this section](/system/basics/#api-tradeoff) for the "why" behind this new API.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```jsx
  <Box border="1px dashed grey" p={[2, 3, 4]} m={2}>
  <Box sx={{ border: "1px dashed grey", p: [2, 3, 4], m: 2 }}>
  ```

- The following properties have been renamed because they are considered deprecated CSS properties by the CSS specification:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  1. `gridGap` to `gap`
  2. `gridColumnGap` to `columnGap`
  3. `gridRowGap` to `rowGap`

  ```diff
  -<Box gridGap={1}>
  -<Box gridColumnGap={2}>
  -<Box gridRowGap={3}>
  +<Box gap={1}>
  +<Box columnGap={2}>
  +<Box rowGap={3}>
  ```

  (Note that the system grid function wasn't documented in v4.)

- The `clone` prop was removed because its behavior can be obtained by applying the `sx` prop directly to the child if it is a Material-UI component.

  ```diff
  -<Box sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }} clone>
  -  <Button>Save</Button>
  -</Box>
  +<Button sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }}>Save</Button>
  ```

- The ability to pass a render prop was removed because its behavior can be obtained by applying the `sx` prop directly to the child if it is a Material-UI component.

  ```diff
  -<Box sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }}>
  -  {(props) => <Button {...props}>Save</Button>}
  -</Box>
  +<Button sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }}>Save</Button>
  ```

  For non-Material-UI components, use the `component` prop.

  ```diff
  -<Box sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }}>
  -  {(props) => <button {...props}>Save</button>}
  -</Box>
  +<Box component="button" sx={{ border: '1px dashed grey' }}>Save</Box>
  ```

### Button

- The button `color` prop is now "primary" by default, and "default" has been removed. This makes the button closer to the Material Design guidelines and simplifies the API.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Button color="default">
  +<Button>
  ```

- `span` element that wraps children has been removed. `label` classKey is also removed. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/26666).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiButton-root">
  -  <span class="MuiButton-label">
       children
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### Chip

- Rename `default` variant to `filled` for consistency.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  Since `filled` is the default value, the variant prop can be deleted:

  ```diff
  -<Chip variant="default">
  +<Chip>
  ```

### Checkbox

- The component doesn't have `.MuiIconButton-root` and `.MuiIconButton-label` class names anymore, target `.MuiButtonBase-root` instead.

  ```diff
  - <span class="MuiIconButton-root MuiButtonBase-root MuiCheckbox-root PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  -   <span class="MuiIconButton-label">
  -     <input class="PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  + <span class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiCheckbox-root PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  +   <span class="PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  ```

### CircularProgress

- The `static` variant has been renamed to `determinate`, and the previous appearance of `determinate` has been replaced by that of `static`. It was an exception to Material Design, and was removed from the specification.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<CircularProgress variant="static" classes={{ static: 'className' }} />
  +<CircularProgress variant="determinate" classes={{ determinate: 'className' }} />
  ```

> NB: If you had previously customized determinate, your customizations are probably no longer valid. Please remove them.

### Collapse

- The `collapsedHeight` prop was renamed `collapsedSize` to support the horizontal direction.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Collapse collapsedHeight={40}>
  +<Collapse collapsedSize={40}>
  ```

- The `classes.container` key was changed to match the convention of the other components.

  ```diff
  -<Collapse classes={{ container: 'collapse' }}>
  +<Collapse classes={{ root: 'collapse' }}>
  ```

### CssBaseline

- The component was migrated to use the `@material-ui/styled-engine` (`emotion` or `styled-components`) instead of `jss`. You should remove the `@global` key when defining the style overrides for it. You could also start using the CSS template syntax over the JavaScript object syntax.

  ```diff
  const theme = createTheme({
    components: {
      MuiCssBaseline: {
  -     styleOverrides: {
  -       '@global': {
  -         html: {
  -           WebkitFontSmoothing: 'auto',
  -         },
  -       },
  -     },
  +     styleOverrides: `
  +       html {
  +         -webkit-font-smoothing: auto;
  +       }
  +     `
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- The `body` font size has changed from `theme.typography.body2` (`0.875rem`) to `theme.typography.body1` (`1rem`).
  To return to the previous size, you can override it in the theme:

  ```js
  const theme = createTheme({
    typography: {
      body1: {
        fontSize: '0.875rem',
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  (Note that this will also affect use of the Typography component with the default `body1` variant).

### Dialog

- The onE\* transition props were removed. Use TransitionProps instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Dialog
  -  onEnter={onEnter}
  -  onEntered={onEntered}
  -  onEntering={onEntering}
  -  onExit={onExit}
  -  onExited={onExited}
  -  onExiting={onExiting}
  +  TransitionProps={{
  +    onEnter,
  +    onEntered,
  +    onEntering,
  +    onExit,
  +    onExited,
  +    onExiting,
  +  }}
   >
  ```

- Remove the `disableBackdropClick` prop because it is redundant.
  Ignore close events from `onClose` when `reason === 'backdropClick'` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  <Dialog
  - disableBackdropClick
  - onClose={handleClose}
  + onClose={(event, reason) => {
  +   if (reason !== 'backdropClick') {
  +     onClose(event, reason);
  +   }
  + }}
  />
  ```

- Remove the `withMobileDialog` higher-order component. The hook API allows a simpler and more flexible solution:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe) by applying hard-coded function to prevent application crash, further fixes are required.

  ```diff
  -import withMobileDialog from '@material-ui/core/withMobileDialog';
  +import { useTheme, useMediaQuery } from '@material-ui/core';

  function ResponsiveDialog(props) {
  - const { fullScreen } = props;
  + const theme = useTheme();
  + const fullScreen = useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down('sm'));
    const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  // ...

  -export default withMobileDialog()(ResponsiveDialog);
  +export default ResponsiveDialog;
  ```

- Flatten DialogTitle DOM structure, remove `disableTypography` prop

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<DialogTitle disableTypography>
  -  <Typography variant="h4" component="h2">
  +<DialogTitle>
  +  <Typography variant="h4" component="span">
       My header
     </Typography>
  ```

### Divider

- Use border instead of background color. It prevents inconsistent height on scaled screens.
  If you have customized the color of the border, you will need to update the CSS property override:

  ```diff
  .MuiDivider-root {
  - background-color: #f00;
  + border-color: #f00;
  }
  ```

### ExpansionPanel

- Rename the `ExpansionPanel` components to `Accordion` to use a more common naming convention:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import ExpansionPanel from '@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanel';
  -import ExpansionPanelSummary from '@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelSummary';
  -import ExpansionPanelDetails from '@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelDetails';
  -import ExpansionPanelActions from '@material-ui/core/ExpansionPanelActions';
  +import Accordion from '@material-ui/core/Accordion';
  +import AccordionSummary from '@material-ui/core/AccordionSummary';
  +import AccordionDetails from '@material-ui/core/AccordionDetails';
  +import AccordionActions from '@material-ui/core/AccordionActions';

  -<ExpansionPanel>
  +<Accordion>
  -  <ExpansionPanelSummary>
  +  <AccordionSummary>
       <Typography>Location</Typography>
       <Typography>Select trip destination</Typography>
  -  </ExpansionPanelSummary>
  +  </AccordionSummary>
  -  <ExpansionPanelDetails>
  +  <AccordionDetails>
       <Chip label="Barbados" onDelete={() => {}} />
       <Typography variant="caption">Select your destination of choice</Typography>
  -  </ExpansionPanelDetails>
  +  </AccordionDetails>
     <Divider />
  -  <ExpansionPanelActions>
  +  <AccordionActions>
       <Button size="small">Cancel</Button>
       <Button size="small">Save</Button>
  -  </ExpansionPanelActions>
  +  </AccordionActions>
  -</ExpansionPanel>
  +</Accordion>
  ```

- TypeScript: The `event` in `onChange` is no longer typed as a `React.ChangeEvent` but `React.SyntheticEvent`.

  ```diff
  -<Accordion onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<{}>, expanded: boolean) => {}} />
  +<Accordion onChange={(event: React.SyntheticEvent, expanded: boolean) => {}} />
  ```

- Rename `focused` to `focusVisible` for consistency:

  ```diff
  <Accordion
    classes={{
  -    focused: 'custom-focus-visible-classname',
  +    focusVisible: 'custom-focus-visible-classname',
    }}
  />
  ```

- Remove `display: flex` from AccordionDetails as its too opinionated.
  Most developers expect a display block.
- Remove `IconButtonProps` prop from AccordionSummary.
  The component renders a `<div>` element instead of an IconButton.
  The prop is no longer necessary.

### Fab

- Rename `round` to `circular` for consistency:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Fab variant="round">
  +<Fab variant="circular">
  ```

- `span` element that wraps children has been removed. `label` classKey is also removed. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/27112).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiFab-root">
  -  <span class="MuiFab-label">
       {children}
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### FormControl

- Change the default variant from `standard` to `outlined`. Standard has been removed from the Material Design guidelines.

  > ✅ This is handled in [variant-prop codemod](#variant-prop), read the details before running this codemod.

  ```diff
  -<FormControl value="Standard" />
  -<FormControl value="Outlined" variant="outlined" />
  +<FormControl value="Standard" variant="standard" />
  +<FormControl value="Outlined" />
  ```

### FormControlLabel

- The `label` prop is now required. If you were using a `FormControlLabel` without a `label`, you can replace it with just the value of the `control` prop.

```diff
-<FormControlLabel control={<Checkbox />} />
+<Checkbox />
```

### Grid

- Rename `justify` prop to `justifyContent` to align with the CSS property name.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Grid justify="center">
  +<Grid justifyContent="center">
  ```

- The props: `alignItems` `alignContent` and `justifyContent` and their `classes` and style overrides keys were removed: "align-items-xs-center", "align-items-xs-flex-start", "align-items-xs-flex-end", "align-items-xs-baseline", "align-content-xs-center", "align-content-xs-flex-start", "align-content-xs-flex-end", "align-content-xs-space-between", "align-content-xs-space-around", "justify-content-xs-center", "justify-content-xs-flex-end", "justify-content-xs-space-between", "justify-content-xs-space-around" and "justify-content-xs-space-evenly". These props are now considered part of the system, not on the `Grid` component itself. If you still wish to add overrides for them, you can use the `theme.components.MuiGrid.variants` options.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  const theme = createTheme({
    components: {
      MuiGrid: {
  -     styleOverrides: {
  -       "align-items-xs-flex-end": {
  -         marginTop: '20px',
  -       },
  -     },
  +     variants: {
  +       props: { alignItems: "flex-end" },
  +       style: {
  +         marginTop: '20px',
  +       },
  +     }],
      },
    },
  });
  ```

### GridList

- Rename the `GridList` components to `ImageList` to align with the current Material Design naming.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

- Rename the GridList `spacing` prop to `gap` to align with the CSS attribute.
- Rename the GridList `cellHeight` prop to `rowHeight`.
- Add the `variant` prop to GridList.
- Rename the GridListItemBar `actionPosition` prop to `position`. (Note also the related classname changes.)
- Use CSS object-fit. For IE11 support either use a polyfill such as
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-fit-images, or continue to use the v4 component.

  ```diff
  -import GridList from '@material-ui/core/GridList';
  -import GridListTile from '@material-ui/core/GridListTile';
  -import GridListTileBar from '@material-ui/core/GridListTileBar';
  +import ImageList from '@material-ui/core/ImageList';
  +import ImageListItem from '@material-ui/core/ImageListItem';
  +import ImageListItemBar from '@material-ui/core/ImageListItemBar';

  -<GridList spacing={8} cellHeight={200}>
  -  <GridListTile>
  +<ImageList gap={8} rowHeight={200}>
  +  <ImageListItem>
      <img src="file.jpg" alt="Image title" />
  -    <GridListTileBar
  +    <ImageListItemBar
        title="Title"
        subtitle="Subtitle"
      />
  -  </GridListTile>
  -</GridList>
  +  </ImageListItem>
  +</ImageList>
  ```

### Hidden

- This component is deprecated because its functionality can be created with the [`sx`](/system/basics/#the-sx-prop) prop or the [`useMediaQuery`](/components/use-media-query) hook.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe) by applying fake `Hidden` component to prevent application crash, further fixes are required.

  Use the `sx` prop to replace `implementation="css"`:

  ```diff
  -<Hidden implementation="css" xlUp><Paper /></Hidden>
  -<Hidden implementation="css" xlUp><button /></Hidden>
  +<Paper sx={{ display: { xl: 'none', xs: 'block' } }} />
  +<Box component="button" sx={{ display: { xl: 'none', xs: 'block' } }} />
  ```

  ```diff
  -<Hidden implementation="css" mdDown><Paper /></Hidden>
  -<Hidden implementation="css" mdDown><button /></Hidden>
  +<Paper sx={{ display: { xs: 'none', md: 'block' } }} />
  +<Box component="button" sx={{ display: { xs: 'none', md: 'block' } }} />
  ```

  Use the `useMediaQuery` hook to replace `implementation="js"`:

  ```diff
  -<Hidden implementation="js" xlUp><Paper /></Hidden>
  +const hidden = useMediaQuery(theme => theme.breakpoints.up('xl'));
  +return hidden ? null : <Paper />;
  ```

### Icon

- The default value of `fontSize` was changed from `default` to `medium` for consistency.
  In the unlikely event that you were using the value `default`, the prop can be removed:

  ```diff
  -<Icon fontSize="default">icon-name</Icon>
  +<Icon>icon-name</Icon>
  ```

### IconButton

- The default size's padding is reduced to `8px` which makes the default IconButton size of `40px`. To get the old default size (`48px`), use `size="large"`. The change was done to better match Google's products when Material Design stopped documenting the icon button pattern.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  - <IconButton>
  + <IconButton size="large">
  ```

- `span` element that wraps children has been removed. `label` classKey is also removed. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/26666).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiIconButton-root">
  -  <span class="MuiIconButton-label">
       <svg />
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### Link

- The default `underline` prop is changed from `"hover"` to `"always"`. To get the same behavior as in v4, apply `defaultProps` in theme

  > ✅ This is handled in [link-underline-hover codemod](#link-underline-hover), read the details before running this codemod.

  ```js
  createTheme({
    components: {
      MuiLink: {
        defaultProps: {
          underline: 'hover',
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

### Menu

- The onE\* transition props were removed. Use TransitionProps instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Menu
  -  onEnter={onEnter}
  -  onEntered={onEntered}
  -  onEntering={onEntering}
  -  onExit={onExit}
  -  onExited={onExited}
  -  onExiting={onExiting}
  +  TransitionProps={{
  +    onEnter,
  +    onEntered,
  +    onEntering,
  +    onExit,
  +    onExited,
  +    onExiting,
  +  }}
   >
  ```

  > Note: The `selectedMenu` variant will no longer vertically align the selected item with the anchor.

- Change the default value of `anchorOrigin.vertical` to follow the Material Design guidelines. The menu now displays below the anchor instead of on top of it.
  You can restore the previous behavior with:

  ```diff
   <Menu
  +  anchorOrigin={{
  +    vertical: 'top',
  +    horizontal: 'left',
  +  }}
  ```

### MenuItem

- The `MenuItem` component inherits the `ButtonBase` component instead of `ListItem`.
  The class names related to "MuiListItem-\*" are removed and theming `ListItem` is no longer affecting `MenuItem`.

  ```diff
  -<li className="MuiButtonBase-root MuiMenuItem-root MuiListItem-root">
  +<li className="MuiButtonBase-root MuiMenuItem-root">
  ```

- prop `listItemClasses` is removed, use `classes` instead.

  ```diff
  -<MenuItem listItemClasses={{...}}>
  +<MenuItem classes={{...}}>
  ```

  Read more about [MenuItem CSS API](/api/menu-item/#css)

### Modal

- Remove the `disableBackdropClick` prop because it is redundant.
  Use `onClose` with `reason === 'backdropClick'` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Modal
  -  disableBackdropClick
  -  onClose={handleClose}
  +  onClose={(event, reason) => {
  +    if (reason !== 'backdropClick') {
  +      onClose(event, reason);
  +    }
  +  }}
   />
  ```

- Remove the `onEscapeKeyDown` prop because it is redundant.
  Use `onClose` with `reason === "escapeKeyDown"` instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Modal
  -  onEscapeKeyDown={handleEscapeKeyDown}
  +  onClose={(event, reason) => {
  +    if (reason === 'escapeKeyDown') {
  +      handleEscapeKeyDown(event);
  +    }
  +  }}
   />
  ```

- Remove `onRendered` prop.
  Depending on your use case either use a [callback ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#callback-refs) on the child element or an effect hook in the child component.

### NativeSelect

- Merge the `selectMenu` slot into `select`. Slot `selectMenu` was redundant. The `root` slot is no longer applied to the select, but to the root.

  ```diff
  -<NativeSelect classes={{ root: 'class1', select: 'class2', selectMenu: 'class3' }} />
  +<NativeSelect classes={{ select: 'class1 class2 class3' }} />
  ```

### OutlinedInput

- Remove the `labelWidth` prop. The `label` prop now fulfills the same purpose, using CSS layout instead of JavaScript measurement to render the gap in the outlined.

  ```diff
  -<OutlinedInput labelWidth={20} />
  +<OutlinedInput label="First Name" />
  ```

### Paper

- Change the background opacity based on the elevation in dark mode. This change was done to follow the Material Design guidelines. You can revert it in the theme:

  ```diff
  const theme = createTheme({
    components: {
      MuiPaper: {
  +     styleOverrides: { root: { backgroundImage: 'unset' } },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

### Pagination

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import Pagination from '@material-ui/lab/Pagination';
  -import PaginationItem from '@material-ui/lab/PaginationItem';
  -import { usePagination } from '@material-ui/lab/Pagination';
  +import Pagination from '@material-ui/core/Pagination';
  +import PaginationItem from '@material-ui/core/PaginationItem';
  +import usePagination from '@material-ui/core/usePagination';
  ```

- Rename `round` to `circular` for consistency:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Pagination shape="round">
  -<PaginationItem shape="round">
  +<Pagination shape="circular">
  +<PaginationItem shape="circular">
  ```

### Popover

- The onE\* transition props were removed. Use TransitionProps instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Popover
  -  onEnter={onEnter}
  -  onEntered={onEntered}
  -  onEntering={onEntering}
  -  onExit={onExit}
  -  onExited={onExited}
  -  onExiting={onExiting}
  +  TransitionProps={{
  +    onEnter,
  +    onEntered,
  +    onEntering,
  +    onExit,
  +    onExited,
  +    onExiting,
  +  }}
   >
  ```

- The `getContentAnchorEl` prop was removed to simplify the positioning logic.

### Popper

- Upgrade [Popper.js](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core) from v1 to v2.
  This third-party library has introduced a lot of changes.<br />
  You can read [their migration guide](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/) or the following summary:

  - The CSS prefixes have changed:
    ```diff
    popper: {
      zIndex: 1,
    - '&[x-placement*="bottom"] $arrow': {
    + '&[data-popper-placement*="bottom"] $arrow': {
    ```
  - Method names have changed:

    ```diff
    -popperRef.current.scheduleUpdate()
    +popperRef.current.update()
    ```

    ```diff
    -popperRef.current.update()
    +popperRef.current.forceUpdate()
    ```

  - Modifiers' API has changed a lot. There are too many changes to be covered here.

### Portal

- Remove `onRendered` prop.
  Depending on your use case either use a [callback ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#callback-refs) on the child element or an effect hook in the child component.

### Radio

- The radio color prop is now "primary" by default. To continue using the "secondary" color, you must explicitly indicate `secondary`. This brings the radio closer to the Material Design guidelines.

  ```diff
  -<Radio />
  +<Radio color="secondary />
  ```

- The component doesn't have `.MuiIconButton-root` and `.MuiIconButton-label` class names anymore, target `.MuiButtonBase-root` instead.

  ```diff
  - <span class="MuiIconButton-root MuiButtonBase-root MuiRadio-root PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  -   <span class="MuiIconButton-label">
  -     <input class="PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  + <span class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiRadio-root PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  +   <span class="PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  ```

### Rating

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import Rating from '@material-ui/lab/Rating';
  +import Rating from '@material-ui/core/Rating';
  ```

- Change the default empty icon to improve accessibility.
  If you have a custom `icon` prop but no `emptyIcon` prop, you can restore the previous behavior with:

  ```diff
   <Rating
     icon={customIcon}
  +  emptyIcon={null}
   />
  ```

- Rename `visuallyhidden` to `visuallyHidden` for consistency:

  ```diff
   <Rating
     classes={{
  -    visuallyhidden: 'custom-visually-hidden-classname',
  +    visuallyHidden: 'custom-visually-hidden-classname',
     }}
   />
  ```

### RootRef

- This component was removed.
  You can get a reference to the underlying DOM node of our components via `ref` prop.
  The component relied on [`ReactDOM.findDOMNode`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode) which is [deprecated in `React.StrictMode`](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#warning-about-deprecated-finddomnode-usage).

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe) by applying fake `RootRef` component to prevent application crash, further fixes are required.

  ```diff
  -<RootRef rootRef={ref}>
  -  <Button />
  -</RootRef>
  +<Button ref={ref} />
  ```

### Select

- Change the default variant from `standard` to `outlined`. Standard has been removed from the Material Design guidelines. If you are composing the Select with a form control component, you only need to update `FormControl`, the select inherits the variant from its context.

  > ✅ This is handled in [variant-prop codemod](#variant-prop), read the details before running this codemod.

  ```diff
  -<Select value="Standard" />
  -<Select value="Outlined" variant="outlined" />
  +<Select value="Standard" variant="standard" />
  +<Select value="Outlined" />
  ```

- Remove the `labelWidth` prop. The `label` prop now fulfills the same purpose, using CSS layout instead of JavaScript measurement to render the gap in the outlined. The TextField already handles it by default.

  ```diff
  -<Select variant="outlined" labelWidth={20} />
  +<Select variant="outlined" label="Gender" />
  ```

- Merge the `selectMenu` slot into `select`. Slot `selectMenu` was redundant. The `root` slot is no longer applied to the select, but to the root.

  ```diff
  -<Select classes={{ root: 'class1', select: 'class2', selectMenu: 'class3' }} />
  +<Select classes={{ select: 'class1 class2 class3' }} />
  ```

### Skeleton

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import Skeleton from '@material-ui/lab/Skeleton';
  +import Skeleton from '@material-ui/core/Skeleton';
  ```

- Rename `circle` to `circular` and `rect` to `rectangular` for consistency:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Skeleton variant="circle" />
  -<Skeleton variant="rect" />
  -<Skeleton classes={{ circle: 'custom-circle-classname', rect: 'custom-rect-classname',  }} />
  +<Skeleton variant="circular" />
  +<Skeleton variant="rectangular" />
  +<Skeleton classes={{ circular: 'custom-circle-classname', rectangular: 'custom-rect-classname',  }} />
  ```

### Slider

- TypeScript: The `event` in `onChange` is no longer typed as a `React.ChangeEvent` but `React.SyntheticEvent`.

  ```diff
  -<Slider onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<{}>, value: unknown) => {}} />
  +<Slider onChange={(event: React.SyntheticEvent, value: unknown) => {}} />
  ```

- The `ValueLabelComponent` and `ThumbComponent` prop is now part of the `components` prop.

  ```diff
   <Slider
  -  ValueLabelComponent={CustomValueLabel}
  -  ThumbComponent={CustomThumb}
  +  components={{
  +    ValueLabel: CustomValueLabel,
  +    Thumb: CustomThumb,
  +  }}
   />
  ```

- Rework the CSS to match the latest [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/components/sliders) and make custom styles more intuitive. [See documentation](/components/slider/).

  <a href="/components/slider/#continuous-sliders"><img width="247" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3165635/121884800-a8808600-cd13-11eb-8cdf-e25de8f1ba73.png" style="margin: auto"></a>

  You can reduce the density of the slider, closer to v4 with the [`size="small"` prop](/components/slider/#sizes).

### Snackbar

- The notification now displays at the bottom left on large screens.
  This better matches the behavior of Gmail, Google Keep, material.io, etc.
  You can restore the previous behavior with:

  ```diff
  -<Snackbar />
  +<Snackbar anchorOrigin={{ vertical: 'bottom', horizontal: 'center' }} />
  ```

- The onE\* transition props were removed. Use TransitionProps instead.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <Snackbar
  -  onEnter={onEnter}
  -  onEntered={onEntered}
  -  onEntering={onEntering}
  -  onExit={onExit}
  -  onExited={onExited}
  -  onExiting={onExiting}
  +  TransitionProps={{
  +    onEnter,
  +    onEntered,
  +    onEntering,
  +    onExit,
  +    onExited,
  +    onExiting,
  +  }}
   >
  ```

### SpeedDial

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import SpeedDial from '@material-ui/lab/SpeedDial';
  -import SpeedDialAction from '@material-ui/lab/SpeedDialAction';
  -import SpeedDialIcon from '@material-ui/lab/SpeedDialIcon';
  +import SpeedDial from '@material-ui/core/SpeedDial';
  +import SpeedDialAction from '@material-ui/core/SpeedDialAction';
  +import SpeedDialIcon from '@material-ui/core/SpeedDialIcon';
  ```

### Stepper

- The root component (Paper) was replaced with a div. Stepper no longer has elevation, nor inherits Paper's props. This change is meant to encourage composition.

  ```diff
  +<Paper square elevation={2}>
  -  <Stepper elevation={2}>
  +  <Stepper>
       <Step>
         <StepLabel>Hello world</StepLabel>
       </Step>
     </Stepper>
  +<Paper>
  ```

- Remove the built-in 24px padding.

  ```diff
  -<Stepper>
  +<Stepper style={{ padding: 24 }}>
     <Step>
       <StepLabel>Hello world</StepLabel>
     </Step>
   </Stepper>
  ```

### SvgIcon

- The default value of `fontSize` was changed from `default` to `medium` for consistency.
  In the unlikey event that you were using the value `default`, the prop can be removed:

  ```diff
  -<SvgIcon fontSize="default">
  +<SvgIcon>
     <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z" />
   </SvgIcon>
  ```

### Switch

- Deprecate the second argument from `onChange`. You can pull out the checked state by accessing `event.target.checked`.

  ```diff
  function MySwitch() {
  - const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>, checked: boolean) => {
  + const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  +   const checked = event.target.checked;
    };

    return <Switch onChange={handleChange} />;
  }
  ```

- The switch color prop is now "primary" by default. To continue using the "secondary" color, you must explicitly indicate `secondary`. This brings the switch closer to the Material Design guidelines.

  ```diff
  -<Switch />
  +<Switch color="secondary" />
  ```

- The component doesn't have `.MuiIconButton-root` and `.MuiIconButton-label` class names anymore, target `.MuiButtonBase-root` instead.

  ```diff
   <span class="MuiSwitch-root">
  -  <span class="MuiIconButton-root MuiButtonBase-root MuiSwitch-switchBase PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  -    <span class="MuiIconButton-label">
  -      <input class="MuiSwitch-input PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  +  <span class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiSwitch-switchBase PrivateSwitchBase-root">
  +    <span class="MuiSwitch-input PrivateSwitchBase-input">
  ```

### Table

- Rename the `default` value of the `padding` prop to `normal`.

  ```diff
  -<Table padding="default" />
  -<TableCell padding="default" />
  +<Table padding="normal" />
  +<TableCell padding="normal" />
  ```

### TablePagination

- The customization of the table pagination's actions labels must be done with the `getItemAriaLabel` prop. This increases consistency with the `Pagination` component.

  ```diff
   <TablePagination
  -  backIconButtonText="Avant"
  -  nextIconButtonText="Après"
  +  getItemAriaLabel={…}
  ```

- Rename `onChangeRowsPerPage` to `onRowsPerPageChange` and `onChangePage` to `onPageChange` due to API consistency.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
   <TablePagination
  -  onChangeRowsPerPage={()=>{}}
  -  onChangePage={()=>{}}
  +  onRowsPerPageChange={()=>{}}
  +  onPageChange={()=>{}}
  ```

- Separate classes for different table pagination labels. This allows simpler customizations.

  ```diff
   <TablePagination
  -  classes={{ caption: 'foo' }}
  +  classes={{ selectLabel: 'foo', displayedRows: 'foo' }}
   />
  ```

- Move the custom class on `input` to `select`. The `input` key is being applied on another element.

  ```diff
   <TablePagination
  -  classes={{ input: 'foo' }}
  +  classes={{ select: 'foo' }}
   />
  ```

### Tabs

- Change the default `indicatorColor` and `textColor ` prop values to "primary".
  This is done to match the most common use cases with Material Design.

  ```diff
  -<Tabs />
  +<Tabs indicatorColor="primary" textColor="inherit" />
  ```

- TypeScript: The `event` in `onChange` is no longer typed as a `React.ChangeEvent` but `React.SyntheticEvent`.

  ```diff
  -<Tabs onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<{}>, value: unknown) => {}} />
  +<Tabs onChange={(event: React.SyntheticEvent, value: unknown) => {}} />
  ```

- The API that controls the scroll buttons has been split it in two props.

  - The `scrollButtons` prop controls when the scroll buttons are displayed depending on the space available.
  - The `allowScrollButtonsMobile` prop removes the CSS media query that systematically hide the scroll buttons on mobile.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<Tabs scrollButtons="on" />
  -<Tabs scrollButtons="desktop" />
  -<Tabs scrollButtons="off" />
  +<Tabs scrollButtons allowScrollButtonsMobile />
  +<Tabs scrollButtons />
  +<Tabs scrollButtons={false} />
  ```

### Tab

- Tab `minWidth` changed from `72px` => `90px` (without media-query) according to [material-design spec](https://material.io/components/tabs#specs)
- Tab `maxWidth` changed from `264px` => `360px` according to [material-design spec](https://material.io/components/tabs#specs)
- `span` element that wraps children has been removed. `wrapper` classKey is also removed. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/26926).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiTab-root">
  -  <span class="MuiTab-wrapper">
       {icon}
       {label}
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### TextField

- Change the default variant from `standard` to `outlined`. Standard has been removed from the Material Design guidelines.

  > ✅ This is handled in [variant-prop codemod](#variant-prop), read the details before running this codemod.

  ```diff
  -<TextField value="Standard" />
  -<TextField value="Outlined" variant="outlined" />
  +<TextField value="Standard" variant="standard" />
  +<TextField value="Outlined" />
  ```

- Rename `rowsMax` prop with `maxRows` for consistency with HTML attributes.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<TextField rowsMax={6}>
  +<TextField maxRows={6}>
  ```

- Better isolate the fixed textarea height behavior to the dynamic one.
  You need to use the `minRows` prop in the following case:

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<TextField rows={2} maxRows={5} />
  +<TextField minRows={2} maxRows={5} />
  ```

- Change ref forwarding expectations on custom `inputComponent`.
  The component should forward the `ref` prop instead of the `inputRef` prop.

  ```diff
  -function NumberFormatCustom(props) {
  -  const { inputRef, onChange, ...other } = props;
  +const NumberFormatCustom = React.forwardRef(function NumberFormatCustom(
  +  props,
  +  ref,
  +) {
    const { onChange, ...other } = props;

    return (
      <NumberFormat
        {...other}
  -     getInputRef={inputRef}
  +     getInputRef={ref}
  ```

- Rename `marginDense` and `inputMarginDense` classes to `sizeSmall` and `inputSizeSmall` to match the prop.

  ```diff
  -<Input margin="dense" />
  +<Input size="small" />
  ```

- Set the InputAdornment `position` prop to `start` or `end`. Use `start` if used as the value of the `startAdornment` prop. Use `end` if used as the value of the `endAdornment` prop.

  ```diff
  -<TextField startAdornment={<InputAdornment>Kg</InputAdornment>} />
  -<TextField endAdornment={<InputAdornment>Kg</InputAdornment>} />
  +<TextField startAdornment={<InputAdornment position="start">Kg</InputAdornment>} />
  +<TextField endAdornment={<InputAdornment position="end">Kg</InputAdornment>} />
  ```

### TextareaAutosize

- Remove the `rows` prop, use the `minRows` prop instead.
  This change aims to clarify the behavior of the prop.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<TextareaAutosize rows={2} />
  +<TextareaAutosize minRows={2} />
  ```

- Rename `rowsMax` prop with `maxRows` for consistency with HTML attributes.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<TextareAutosize rowsMax={6}>
  +<TextareAutosize maxRows={6}>
  ```

- Rename `rowsMin` prop with `minRows` for consistency with HTML attributes.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -<TextareAutosize rowsMin={1}>
  +<TextareAutosize minRows={1}>
  ```

### ToggleButton

- Move the component from the lab to the core. The component is now stable.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  ```diff
  -import ToggleButton from '@material-ui/lab/ToggleButton';
  -import ToggleButtonGroup from '@material-ui/lab/ToggleButtonGroup';
  +import ToggleButton from '@material-ui/core/ToggleButton';
  +import ToggleButtonGroup from '@material-ui/core/ToggleButtonGroup';
  ```

- `span` element that wraps children has been removed. `label` classKey is also removed. More details about [this change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/27111).

  ```diff
   <button class="MuiToggleButton-root">
  -  <span class="MuiToggleButton-label">
       {children}
  -  </span>
   </button>
  ```

### Tooltip

- Tooltips are now interactive by default.

  The previous default behavior failed [success criterion 1.4.3 ("hoverable") in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus).
  To reflect the new default value, the prop was renamed to `disableInteractive`.
  If you want to restore the old behavior (thus not reaching level AA), you can apply the following diff:

  ```diff
  -<Tooltip>
  +<Tooltip disableInteractive>

  # Interactive tooltips no longer need the `interactive` prop.
  -<Tooltip interactive>
  +<Tooltip>
  ```

### Typography

- Remove the `srOnly` variant. You can use the `visuallyHidden` utility in conjunction with the `sx` prop instead.

  ```diff
  +import { visuallyHidden } from '@material-ui/utils';

  -<Typography variant="srOnly">Create a user</Typography>
  +<span style={visuallyHidden}>Create a user</span>
  ```

- The following `classes` and style overrides keys were removed: "colorInherit", "colorPrimary", "colorSecondary", "colorTextPrimary", "colorTextSecondary", "colorError", "displayInline" and "displayBlock". These props are now considered part of the system, not on the `Typography` component itself. If you still wish to add overrides for them, you can use the `theme.components.MuiTypography.variants` options. For example

  ```diff
  const theme = createTheme({
    components: {
      MuiTypography: {
  -     styleOverrides: {
  -       colorSecondary: {
  -         marginTop: '20px',
  -       },
  -     },
  +     variants: {
  +       props: { color: "secondary" },
  +       style: {
  +         marginTop: '20px',
  +       },
  +     }],
      },
    },
  });
  ```

### Theme

- The default background color is now `#fff` in light mode and `#121212` in dark mode.
  This matches the Material Design guidelines.
- Breakpoints are now treated as values instead of [ranges](https://v4.material-ui.com/customization/breakpoints/#default-breakpoints). The behavior of `down(key)` was changed to define a media query below the value defined by the corresponding breakpoint (exclusive), rather than the breakpoint above.
  `between(start, end)` was also updated to define a media query for the values between the actual values of start (inclusive) and end (exclusive).
  When using the `down()` breakpoints utility you need to update the breakpoint key by one step up. When using the `between(start, end)` the end breakpoint should also be updated by one step up.

  > ✅ This is handled in [🪄preset-safe codemod](#preset-safe).

  Here are some examples of the changes required:

  ```diff
  -theme.breakpoints.down('sm') // '@media (max-width:959.95px)' - [0, sm + 1) => [0, md)
  +theme.breakpoints.down('md') // '@media (max-width:959.95px)' - [0, md)
  ```

  ```diff
  -theme.breakpoints.between('sm', 'md') // '@media (min-width:600px) and (max-width:1279.95px)' - [sm, md + 1) => [0, lg)
  +theme.breakpoints.between('sm', 'lg') // '@media (min-width:600px) and (max-width:1279.95px)' - [0, lg)
  ```

  ```diff
  -theme.breakpoints.between('sm', 'xl') // '@media (min-width:600px)'
  +theme.breakpoints.up('sm') // '@media (min-width:600px)'
  ```

  The same should be done when using the `Hidden` component:

  ```diff
  -<Hidden smDown>{...}</Hidden> // '@media (min-width:600px)'
  +<Hidden mdDown>{...}</Hidden> // '@media (min-width:600px)'
  ```

- The default breakpoints were changed to better match the common use cases. They also better match the Material Design guidelines. [Read more about the change](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/21902)

  ```diff
  {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 600,
  - md: 960,
  + md: 900,
  - lg: 1280,
  + lg: 1200,
  - xl: 1920,
  + xl: 1536,
  }
  ```

  If you prefer the old breakpoint values, use the snippet below.

  ```js
  import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  const theme = createTheme({
    breakpoints: {
      values: {
        xs: 0,
        sm: 600,
        md: 960,
        lg: 1280,
        xl: 1920,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

### `@material-ui/types`

- Rename the exported `Omit` type in `@material-ui/types`. The module is now called `DistributiveOmit`. The change removes the confusion with the built-in `Omit` helper introduced in TypeScript v3.5. The built-in `Omit`, while similar, is non-distributive. This leads to differences when applied to union types. [See this StackOverflow answer for further details](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57103940/1009797).

  ```diff
  -import { Omit } from '@material-ui/types';
  +import { DistributiveOmit } from '@material-ui/types';
  ```

## Migrate `makeStyles` to emotion

This is the last step in the migration process to remove `@material-ui/styles` package from your codebase.

We recommend 2 options.

### 1. Use `styled` or `sx` API

- **Customize Material-UI Component**

  ```diff
  import Chip from '@material-ui/core/Chip';
  - import makeStyles from '@material-ui/styles/makeStyles';
  + import { styled } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  - const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
  -   wrapper: {
  -     display: 'flex',
  -   },
  -   chip: {
  -     padding: theme.spacing(1, 1.5),
  -     boxShadow: theme.shadows[1],
  -   }
  - }))
  + const Root = styled('div')({
  +   display: 'flex',
  + })

  function App() {
  - const classes = useStyles();
    return (
  -   <div>
  -     <Chip className={classes.chip} label="Chip" />
  -   </div>
  +   <Root>
  +     <Chip label="Chip" sx={{ py: 1, px: 1.5, boxShadow: 1 }} />
  +   </Root>
    )
  }
  ```

- **Apply styles in a page**

  ```diff
  import Button, { buttonClasses } from '@material-ui/core/Button';
  - import makeStyles from '@material-ui/styles/makeStyles';
  + import { styled } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

  - const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
  -   root: {
  -     // root css
  -   },
  -   cta: {
  -     // cta css
  -   },
  -   footer: {
  -     // footer css
  -   },
  - }))

  + const classes = {
  +   root: 'Marketing-root',
  +   cta: buttonClasses.root, // buttonClasses is typed safe
  +   footer: 'Marketing-footer',
  + }

  + const Root = styled('div')((theme) => ({
  +   // root css,
  +   [`& .${classes.cta}`]: {
  +     // cta css
  +   },
  +   [`& .${classes.footer}]: {
  +     // cta footer
  +   }
  + }))

  function App() {
  - const classes = useStyles();
    return (
  -   <div>
  +   <Root>
        <div>
          <img />
          <div>
            <Button className={classes.cta}>Get started</Button>
          </div>
        </div>
        <footer className={classes.footer}>
          ...
        </footer>
  +   </Root>
  -   </div>
    )
  }
  ```

> This approach touch only the styling part but increase CSS specificity.

### 2. Use [tss-react](https://github.com/garronej/tss-react)

The API is similar to JSS `makeStyles` but work with emotion.

  <!-- Add material-ui component migration example -->

> **Note:** this library is not maintained by Material-UI. If you have any issue regarding to it, please open an issue in [tss-react repository](https://github.com/garronej/tss-react/issues/new).

💡 Once you migrate all of the styling, remove unnecessary `@material-ui/styles` by

```sh
npm uninstall @material-ui/styles

// or with `yarn`
yarn remove @material-ui/styles
```

## Troubleshooting

### Storybook emotion with v5

If your project use Storybook v6.x, you will need to update `.storybook/main.js` webpack config to use the most recent version of emotion.

```js
// .storybook/main.js

const path = require('path');
const toPath = (filePath) => path.join(process.cwd(), filePath);

module.exports = {
  webpackFinal: async (config) => {
    return {
      ...config,
      resolve: {
        ...config.resolve,
        alias: {
          ...config.resolve.alias,
          '@emotion/core': toPath('node_modules/@emotion/react'),
          'emotion-theming': toPath('node_modules/@emotion/react'),
        },
      },
    };
  },
};
```

### Cannot read property `scrollTop` of null

This error comes from `Fade`, `Grow`, `Slide`, `Zoom` components due to missing DOM Node.

You need to make sure that the children forward ref to DOM for custom component.

```jsx
// Ex. 1 ✅ html tag works since it is a DOM
<Fade in>
  <div>
    <CustomComponent />
  </div>
</Fade>

// Ex. 2 ❌ This will cause error. don't use Fragment as a child
<Fade in>
  <React.Fragment>
    <CustomComponent />
  </React.Fragment>
</Fade>;

// Ex. 3 ❌ This will cause error because `CustomComponent` does not forward ref to DOM
function CustomComponent() {
  return <div>...</div>;
}

<Fade in>
  <CustomComponent />
</Fade>;
```

```js
// ✅ Fixed by using `React.forwardRef` and pass to DOM.
const CustomComponent = React.forwardRef(function CustomComponent(props, ref) {
  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      ...
    </div>
  )
})

<Fade in>
  <CustomComponent />
</Fade>
```

### [Types] Property "palette", "spacing" does not exist on type 'DefaultTheme'

Since `makeStyles` is now exported from `@material-ui/styles` package which does not know about `Theme` in the core package. To fix this, you need to augment the `DefaultTheme` (empty object) in `@material-ui/styles` with `Theme` from the core. [Read more about module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation)

**Typescript Project**

Put this snippet to your theme file:

```ts
// it could be your App.tsx file or theme file that is included in your tsconfig.json
import { Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

declare module '@material-ui/styles/defaultTheme' {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface (remove this line if you don't have the rule enabled)
  interface DefaultTheme extends Theme {}
}
```

**Javascript Project**

If your IDE (ex. VSCode) is able to infer types from `d.ts` file, create `index.d.ts` in your `src` folder with this snippet:

```js
// index.d.ts
declare module "@material-ui/private-theming" {
  import type { Theme } from "@material-ui/core/styles";

  interface DefaultTheme extends Theme {}
}
```
