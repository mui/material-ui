    summary: 'How many developer licenses do I need?',

      <React.Fragment>
        The number of licenses purchased must correspond to the number of concurrent developers
        contributing changes to the front-end code of projects that use MUI X Pro or Premium.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Example 1.</b> Company 'A' is developing an application named 'AppA'. The app needs to
        render 10k rows of data in a table and allow users to group, filter, and sort. The dev team
        adds MUI X Pro to the project to satisfy this requirement. 5 front-end and 10 back-end
        developers are working on 'AppA'. Only 1 developer is tasked with configuring and modifying
        the data grid. Only the front-end developers are contributing code to the front-end so
        Company 'A' purchases 5 licenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Example 2.</b> A UI development team at Company 'A' creates its own UI library for
        internal development and includes MUI X Pro as a component. The team working on 'AppA' uses
        the new library and so does the team working on 'AppB'. 'AppA' has 5 front-end developers
        and 'AppB' has 3. There are 2 front-end developers on the UI development team. Company 'B'
        purchases 10 licenses.

          <li>Solutions for internal company use</li>
          <li>Hosted applications</li>
          <li>Commercial solutions deployed for end-users</li>

          'Deployment' section of the EULA
        </Link>
        , you can sublicense the software if it's made part of a larger work. The new licenses must
        be in writing and substantially the same as these EULA.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Example 1.</b> Agency 'A' is building two applications for companies 'B' and 'C'. Agency
        'A' purchases four licenses for four developers. They build the applications and sublicense
        the software to companies 'B' and 'C' without any extra fee. Company 'B' can deploy the
        application built by the agency without modifying the sources. Company 'C' decides to
        continue working on the application. They purchase one license per developer working on the
        front end of the application.

        There are only two limitations that require additional discussion with our sales team:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A product that exposes the components in a form that allows for using them to build
            applications, for example, in a CMS or a design-builder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modules/components that DO NOT add significant primary functionality. Example: a theme
            for a set of components that is sold as a separate product and includes the XGrid
            components. In such cases, we offer reseller arrangements so that everyone has an
            incentive to enter into a relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Our pricing model requires all developers working on a project using MUI X Pro or Premium to
        be licensed. This is intended to make it easier for you and your team to know if the right
        number of developers are licensed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our licensing model also requires developers indirectly using MUI X Pro or Premium (e.g.
        through a wrapper library) to be licensed.
        <br />
        <br />
        The price point per developer is adjusted to be lower than if only direct use needed a
