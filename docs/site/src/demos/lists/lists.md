# Lists

[Lists](https://material.google.com/components/lists.html) present multiple line items vertically as a single continuous element.

Lists are made up of a continuous column of rows. Each row contains a tile. Primary actions fill the tile, and supplemental actions are represented by icons and text.

Lists are best suited for similar data types.

### Checkbox

A checkbox can either be a primary action or a secondary action.

The checkbox is the primary action and the state indicator for the list item. The comment button is a secondary action and a separate target.
