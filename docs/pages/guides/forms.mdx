## Integration into forms

Pickers are quite complex controls, where date can be submitted from different places, so we can't provide events as arguments in
an `onChange` callback. So you need to set up form field manually, based on the `onChange` param.

Also we are providing prop `onError` that is ready-to-use for validation. This callback fires once
the selected value by user is becomes invalid based on the passed validation props.
It returns you a reason why error was occured so it is possible to render custom error message.

#### Validation props

There are different validation props for each component. The `reason` prop returned by `onError`
will basically return you a name of prop that match an error (e.g. `minDate` or `shouldDisableDate`)

For reference, here is the list of validation props for [DatePicker](/api/DatePicker) in the order of applying:

- `shouldDisableDate`
- `disableFuture`
- `disablePast`
- `minDate`
- `maxDate`

#### Formik

Here is an example how to use `onError` callback in integration with [formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik)

#### Formik with validation schema

This example shows how to use formik and custom validation schema. When using this approach please make sure that
your validation schema logic covers all the [validation props](#validation-props) that are passed to the `DatePicker`.
