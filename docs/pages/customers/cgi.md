## Challenge

As the energy sector was undergoing rapid transformation, CGI needed a high-performance, scalable GUI to support Techyon's advanced capabilities.
Their key challenges included:

- Performance bottlenecks, as handling massive data from their Google Cloud without pagination led to slow load times and poor user experience.
- Creating an intuitive, consistent, and user-friendly interface for energy operators and analysts.
- Ensuring developers could quickly build and iterate without wasting time on minor yet complex UI issues.

## Solution

CGI adopted **MUI X Data Grid Premium** as the foundation for Techyon's GUI, providing:

- A seamless, modern UI for managing workflows and energy data.
- High-performance data handling, even with tens of thousands of rows displayed at once.
- Structured, easy-to-use components, enabling developers to build interfaces effortlessly.
- A consistent design system, ensuring a professional and unified look across the platform.

## Results

After implementing MUI X, the Techyon team no longer had to deal with a sluggish UI, and could reap the benefits of instant data loading for large datasets. A streamlined design process that enabled their developers to create polished interfaces without needing a design background. MUI X's well-documented components simplified UI implementation and helped them achieve faster development cycles.

## Developer experience

CGI's team found MUI X's documentation to be clear, organized, and developer-friendly, making it easy for both new and experienced developers to use components.

:::info
Pro tip from CGI: For developers handling large datasets, MUI X's Data Grid is highly optimized out of the box, but profiling your UI and using pagination or lazy loading can further enhance performance.
:::

For teams looking to build data-heavy applications efficiently, CGI highly recommends MUI X as a powerful, time-saving solution.
Its advanced components (such as grids, filters, and tables) provide both flexibility and enterprise-grade performance.
