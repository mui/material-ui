## Overview

[Coupa Software](https://www.coupa.com/) is a cloud-based spend management platform that helps businesses streamline procurement, invoicing, expense management, and supplier management. They needed to modernize their frontend components to meet strict deadlines for a new mid-market product. They selected MUI to replace their outdated in-house component library, leveraging MUI's comprehensive ecosystem and advanced components.

  We had very strict and aggressive deadlines, and we were able to meet them. If we had done it using our own components, it probably would have been at least six months to eight months over the deadline. So, with MUI we got 50% faster. But when you put that on a longer period, I think that number is bigger because of maintenance and shifting paradigms and business needs.

## Challenge

Coupa was struggling with a 12-year-old in-house component library that was:

- Built on React 17 but difficult to maintain and update
- Lacking a unified design system
- Limited in component offerings
- Difficult to scale as it was built specifically for one application
- Inconsistent component nomeclature

As Ali explained, it was built over time and not with a complete plan. So some of the things were difficult to update and maintain. It didn't have a design system behind it, which made it difficult to create a unified user experience.

## Solution

After researching various options, Coupa implemented MUI with a focus on:

- Creating custom theme to match their existing design system
- Integrating MUI components within a greenfield application
- Expanding usage from core components to MUI X advanced components (date picker and charts)
- Doubling the licenses as adoption grew grew across projects

## Results

After integrating MUI X, Coupa managed to meet an aggressive one-year product delivery deadline resulting in a 50% faster time to market.
They significantly enhanced user experience with a unified, modern interface.
They also increased the platform production quality with reduced P0, P1 bugs.
Recently, they also integrated MUI X Charts for a new AI chatbot feature.

I think our biggest advantage with using MUI is the maturity of the product. Beyond a dedicated team that offers enterprise level support, there's a big community around it. It's easy to find resources. While some of the newer libraries might do some shiny new things, their reliability and the future is always questionable. - Ali

## Developer experience

The switch to MUI dramatically improved the developer workflow as the consistent component APIs made implementation timelines predictable.
The MUI component structure and the comprehensive documentation reduced learning curve and simplified onboarding for new team members.
It also reduced friction between design and development teams.

From the engineer's perspective, it's a unified experience to use the components because all of your components' props and signatures are similar. So it makes it easy for even teams that we do support internally to be able to utilize the components. - Ali.
