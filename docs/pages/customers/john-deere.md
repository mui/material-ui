## Challenge

With multiple teams working towards different design goals, maintaining consistency for developers was a major challenge.
Frontend teams at John Deere needed a reliable, standardized component library to bridge the gaps in their internal design system.

## Solution

By integrating **MUI X Premium Data Grid**, John Deere's teams found a baseline of standardized components to rely on, ensuring a cohesive development approach in places where their in-house Fuel Design System didn't provide the necessary coverage.

## Results

- Improved consistency – Developers could use MUI X as a standardized foundation across teams.
- Faster development – Teams saved time by leveraging ready-to-use, high-performance, battle-tested components.
- Enhanced flexibility – MUI X filled in the gaps where the internal design system fell short.
