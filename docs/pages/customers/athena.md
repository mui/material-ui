## Challenge

Athena needed a customizable and performant UI framework to build their schema management interface, which required handling large datasets and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Solution

To power their schema management interface, Athena integrated the **Data Grid Premium** and the **Tree View**, leveraging MUI X's structured approach to UI development.
Key benefits of using MUI X included:

- Higher-level abstractions – Built on top of MUI (Material UI) for seamless integration.
- Faster iteration cycles – Simplified the development of complex UI components.
- Component-based architecture – Aligned perfectly with React's ecosystem.
- Efficient code organization – Improved maintainability over inline styling methods like Tailwind CSS.

/>

In the image above from Athena's platform, the Tree View in the first column neatly organizes the assets, while the customized and responsive Data Grid in the third column shows query output in a tabular form.

## Results

After integrating MUI X, Athena saw:

- Increased development speed – Reducing time-to-market for complex UI features.
- Improved UI consistency – A polished and cohesive experience across the platform.
- Better performance and flexibility – Smooth, interactive data management without performance bottlenecks.

A defining moment came when the team rapidly implemented direct asset renaming and customized components using MUI X.
The ease of integration and instant improvements in interactivity and UI cohesion reinforced the framework's powerful capabilities.

## Developer experience

Athena found the MUI documentation to be highly detailed, structured and clear. The step-by-step guides helped them implement complex features like cell editing, selection, and customization easily. Developers additionally liked the seamless React integration as it helped them optimize the development process, accelerating feature rollouts and overall delivery speed.

MUI X is now an essential tool in Athena's development stack, enabling rapid, scalable, and high-performance UI solutions.
