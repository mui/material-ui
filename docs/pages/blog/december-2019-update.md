# December 2019 Update

Olivier Tassinari. January 7, 2020.

Here are the most significant improvements in December:

- 🚨 We have introduced a new [Alert](https://material-ui.com/components/alert/) component in the lab, thanks to **[@dimitropoulos](https://github.com/dimitropoulos)** ([#18702](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/18702)). The component also supports composition with a [Snackbar](/components/snackbars/#customized-snackbars).

- 👤 We have added [stacking](/components/avatars/#grouped) support to the avatar.

- 🌎 We have almost doubled the number of supported [locales](/guides/localization/#localization) from 13 to 22, thanks to our awesome contributors. [Help us](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui/src/locale/index.js) double this number next month 🚀!

But this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 168 commits from 73 different contributors. We have changed 1,059 files with 13,468 additions and 8,584 deletions.

## Our roadmap intent for January

*(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)*
