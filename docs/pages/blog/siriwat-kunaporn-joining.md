We are excited to share that [Siriwat Kunaporn](https://x.com/siriwatknp) (Jun) has joined MUI.
He started a couple of days ago full-time and is part of the core components team.

Before joining MUI, Jun worked as a software engineer at ThoughtWorks.
He has spent the last three years as a full-stack engineer, focusing more on React and the implementation of great-looking UIs. Jun is passionate about creating UIs that feel amazing.

We were impressed by his previous work on exploring the customization potential of MUI in [MUI Treasury](https://mui-treasury.com/).
He's has demonstrated his care of the details and interest in design.

While we can't predict the future, Jun will initially help us get Material UI v5 down the finish line.
Then, he will be focusing almost exclusively on pushing the company further in the design realm.
We might start with a [second theme](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/22485), a rebranding, a revamp of the documentation or the implementation of ["blocks"](https://deploy-preview-16--material-ui-blocks.netlify.app/).

Jun is the second of a series of 5 new positions we have recently opened and filled.
We will cross the 10 person milestone in the coming weeks.
We have opened these positions as our revenue growth allows.
These new roles will help accelerate our mission, strengthen our existing offering, and initiate a new vertical.

We couldn't be more excited to have Jun on the team!
