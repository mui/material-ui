We‚Äôre thrilled to share a different kind of message today. In one of our last announcement updates, we committed to shipping the next major version of Material UI with Material Design 3 (MD3) support in time for September 2025. As we dug deeper into that work, it became obvious that simply layering MD3 on top of the existing codebase wouldn‚Äôt deliver the experience the community deserves.

Instead, we decided to rebuild the entire component library on top of Base UI, our headless foundation, and incorporate all the lessons we‚Äôve learned from years of maintaining Material UI.

The result is a new library‚Äîcodenamed new-lib. A modular, theme-agnostic component library that delivers white-label design, out of the box features, and unprecedented composability for enterprise applications. New-lib will serve as the spiritual successor to Material UI and carry our ecosystem forward.

:::info
We are not abandoning Material UI. New-lib is the next generation of the library you know and love. It builds on everything we've learned and preserves the developer-centric principles that have made Material UI successful, while introducing a modern API for improved customization and a much more flexible theming system that works with any styling tech stack (for example, Tailwind, Emotion, or plain CSS with CSS variables). Material UI and MUI X remain in long-term support, and we‚Äôll provide migration guides and hands-on support to help you upgrade. Think of new-lib as the natural evolution of Material UI rather than a separate product.

## Why rebuild Material UI?

Over the last six years, the web has changed dramatically. Design standards are higher, applications are more complex, and the expectations of enterprise teams have grown. When we looked at our existing codebase through that lens, it became clear that a ground-up refactor was the best path forward.

**Decouple from a single design language.** During our journey, we've noticed that most teams start with our Material for its consistency, but then they often override nearly everything to match their own brand. That often meant wrestling with specificity, custom CSS, and brittle overrides. By making our components theme-agnostic and providing a white-label design system out of the box, you get a polished starting point without being boxed into a particular look; and you can layer on your brand with far less friction.

**Unlock deeper customization.** Our new composition-based architecture lets you customize individual nodes without wrestling with class names. Instead of treating components as monoliths, you can swap out or compose just the pieces you need. Advanced scenarios‚Äîlike removing the Data Grid‚Äôs filtering panel or replacing a calendar‚Äôs header‚Äîbecome even more straightforward.

## Themes: white-label by default

One of the biggest lessons from Material UI is that developers often don‚Äôt need Material Design; they need their design. With new-lib, we‚Äôre introducing a white-label design system out of the box. You‚Äôll find a range of polished starter themes that help your application look great from the start without configuration. When you‚Äôre ready to differentiate, new-lib‚Äôs token-based theming system lets you define your own palette, spacing, typography, radius values and etc‚Äîor switch to an entirely custom theme.

**< in-depth examples: we want to show some examples here of theming and design >**

## Composition: break down and build up

Material UI has always been built on solid abstractions, but some components were hard to customize without forking code. New-lib takes composition to heart. Each component is a collection of smaller building blocks that you can assemble or replace as needed. For instance, you can still import a fully configured DataGrid, but you can also import only the pieces you need‚Äîlike a column header or row renderer‚Äîand compose them together. This approach provides the best of both worlds: a batteries-included default for rapid development, and a composable foundation when you need to take over control.

## Distribution: npm package vs copy-and-paste

New-lib ships as an npm package rather than a copy-and-paste library (e.g., shadcn/ui). That means you install, import, and update‚Äîwithout maintaining a local fork of duplicated source.

- **Centralized updates:** you get fixes, features, and security patches via semver, not by diffing pasted files.
- **Less drift:** avoid divergence between your app and the upstream library over time.
- **Better ownership:** compose and override what you need in code; you own what you need to own to deliver your design system.
- **Tooling-friendly:** first-class TypeScript types, tree-shaking, and CI-friendly upgrades.

If you prefer to vendor specific pieces, you still can‚Äîbut the default path is clean, maintainable, and designed for long-term sustainability.

## Migration and continuity

We understand that adopting a new major can be intimidating. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre committed to making the transition as smooth as possible. When new-lib reaches beta later this year, you can expect:

**An incremental migration path.** You‚Äôll be able to install new-lib alongside Material UI and gradually migrate screens or components. We‚Äôll publish guides, codemods, AI tooling, and examples to help you update your code.

**Long-term support for prior majors.** Material UI will continue receiving critical fixes while you upgrade, similar to how MUI X extended the LTS window when v8 was released.

**Dedicated support options.** Our Customer Success team is scaling up to provide tailored assistance to our enterprise customers. Whether you need training, hands-on migration help, or architectural guidance, we‚Äôll be there.

## Material Design 3: your vote matters

We acknowledge that Material Design may still have a place in the ecosystem, but we also recognise that it shouldn‚Äôt be the default for every product. To decide where to prioritize our resources, we‚Äôre asking the community to vote on whether Material Design 3 should be one of the first official themes for new-lib.

## What‚Äôs next and how to get involved

Our roadmap for new-lib is ambitious. Over the coming months, we‚Äôll release RFCs, beta packages, and developer previews (starting at the end of 2025). In parallel, we‚Äôll continue to deliver improvements to the existing Material UI ecosystem, including updates and new features for our advanced components scheduled for March 2026. Here are a few initiatives on our radar:

**Additional themes.** Beyond a default white-label theme, we plan to ship themes inspired by other design systems and brand palettes. Material design 3 will be a theme depending on the community's wishes.

**AI-ready components.** Just as MUI X is exploring AI-assisted features, we‚Äôre experimenting with patterns and APIs that make AI-driven UIs straightforward to build.

**Stable release around September/October 2026,** though the exact timeline is still subject to change based on your feedback and the results of our beta program.

[Join the discussion on our GitHub](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/discussions) and [vote on MD3](https://tally.so/r/w8X8Po).

Your feedback will shape all of these initiatives. We can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think and to build the next generation of UI components together.
