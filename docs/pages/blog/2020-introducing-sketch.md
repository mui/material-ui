Today, we're excited to introduce the Sketch symbols ðŸ’Ž for MaterialÂ UI.

[![preview](/static/blog/2020-introducing-sketch/product-preview.png)](https://mui.com/store/items/sketch-react/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=introducing-sketch)

<p class="blog-description">Available on our <a href="https://mui.com/store/items/sketch-react/">store</a></p>

The UI kit contains all the MaterialÂ UI components with states and variations which gives 1,500+ unique elements. All components are designed with the most up to date release.

We dream of a world where designers and developers can share the same tools. We wish to streamline the creation process of great UIs.
This new product brings you one step closer to this long term goal. It enables designers to provide developers close to production "handoffs". It aims to **maximize efficiency and consistency**.

## Why

### Frequent requests

Over the last few months, we have seen a growing number of designers asking for these Sketch symbols.
For instance, there is a [StackÂ Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38834629/material-ui-sketch-files) with over 4,000 views. It has been a common request on X: [one](https://x.com/TimoMajerski/status/1144503789619224578), [two](https://x.com/jonminori/status/1141121330156310528), [three](https://x.com/ProfessorXavior/status/1196522875706056705), [etc](https://x.com/JeffreyKaine/status/1133435042259120132).

### No great alternatives

For a long time, we have ignored the problem. We were recommending users to try alternatives out. However, we realized that it wasn't a great answer. There were no good solutions out there:

- **Sketch** has [some symbols](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEEAA.png) for Material Design. Unfortunately, they cover <30% of the components available in MaterialÂ UI, use an outdated version of the specification, and focus on mobile (leaving desktop behind).
- **Material Design** had a [Sketch plugin](https://m2.material.io/resources/theme-editor/).
  Unfortunately, it was recently retired, was supporting fewer components than MaterialÂ UI, and didn't use the same wording/structure as MaterialÂ UI that made it harder to move from design to implementation.
- Anything else is paid.

### Gain efficiency

No matter what your role, you'll be more efficient with these assets:

**UI / UX Designers ðŸ’…**

Save time using this large library of UI components, icons and styles to deliver your work faster. You can customize the kit however you want to match your product's brand.

**Product managers / Entrepreneurs ðŸ§ª**

Create MVPs efficiently and save hundreds of hours on UI Design. This is a great place to start if your product or brand needs a design system. Equip your team with this library for Sketch and build consistent products faster.

**Developers ðŸ› **

Gain in autonomy, design beautiful, consistent and accessible interface without relying on designers. You can preview how it will look before coding it.
The UI kit was created specifically for MaterialÂ UI, a popular React UI library with a comprehensive set of components.

## More tools

According to a [recent user survey](https://medium.com/google-design/state-of-design-systems-2019-ff5f26ada71) ran by the Material Design Team, Sketch is the most popular tool used by teams to manage design systems. However, it's not the only tool.
