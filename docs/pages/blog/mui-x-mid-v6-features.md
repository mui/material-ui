## Date Pickers

### Support for time zones

No more hassle displaying dates in the time zones of your choice. ðŸŒŽ

You can effortlessly display and select dates and times in different time zones, without worrying about conversion logic or maintaining consistency with your backend.

</video>

Set the `timezone` prop to define which time zone the Date, Time, or DateTime should be displayed in.

```tsx
<TimePicker
  value={value}
  onChange={setValue}
  timezone="Pacific/Honolulu" // Can be in any timezone of your choice
  label={'Rendered in "Pacific/Honolulu"'}
/>
```

Check the [full instructions](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/timezone/) for more information on using this feature in your application.

### Digital clock

The digital clock is an alternative to the Time Pickers' [analog clock](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-clock/).
The original proposal was mainly focused on mobile devices, whereas the new interface is designed for a desktop experience for better time precision.
This new addition makes our Date Pickers even more versatile and user-friendly than before.
It's available as the default variant for desktops on both the [Time Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/) and the [Date Time Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-time-picker/).

Check out all the possibilities in the [Date Pickersâ€”Digital clock documentation](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/digital-clock/), and let us know your thoughts!

## Data Grid

### Filter on column headers [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')

Filtering on column headers gives users the ability to quickly filter data without any additional menu.
Use the `unstable_headerFilters` prop to activate this feature.

The new filter fields are displayed below the headers, and are synchronized with the filter panel.
If you prefer more simplicity, you can disable the default filter panel using the `disableColumnFilter` prop, and set filters to use only the default operator.

For more details on how to use and customize the filters, check out its [documentation page](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/filtering/header-filters/).

### Copy and paste [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan 'premium plan')

After setting the `experimentalFeatures={{ clipboardPaste: true }}` prop, you can copy and paste data directly to and from your Data Grid.

This new feature is extremely versatile, and you can exchange data from other fields, other grids, and even directly to and from the spreadsheet tool of your choice.

  <source src="/static/blog/mui-x-mid-v6-features/copy_paste.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

This feature is integrated with the editing API, so pasted data can be persisted using the `processRowUpdate` prop to update your data source through your usual editing validation process.
The callbacks `clipboardPasteStart` and `clipboardPasteEnd` are fired during the clipboard paste operation, which can be useful for extra customizations around the event.

For more details on how to use clipboard copy and paste, check out the [Data Gridâ€”Clipboard documentation](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/clipboard/).

## Charts - alpha version

We are delighted to announce the upcoming expansion of MUIÂ X: a brand-new suite of components for building and customizing charts.

With MUIÂ X Charts, you can choose from a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, area charts, scatter plots, and more.
Each chart type is thoughtfully crafted with attention to detail, ensuring that the visual representations are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also highly effective in conveying complex data.

And it ships with gorgeous palettes that were specially crafted by our designers!

Check out the video below, highlighting some of our Charts:

  <source src="/static/blog/mui-x-mid-v6-features/charts_final_v1.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

As we progress toward the stable version, we're committed to enhancing the overall experience for developers and users, so your feedback is fundamental!

We will also steadily expand our portfolio with new chart types such as [Heatmap](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/heatmap/), [Funnel](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/funnel/), [Gantt](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/gantt/), and more.
If there's a specific chart visualization you'd like us to prioritize, we encourage you to upvote the respective [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22component%3A+charts%22+label%3A%22waiting+for+%F0%9F%91%8D%22).
Your input can directly influence our development schedule, so don't hesitate to let us know what matters most to you!

## Tree View is moving to MUIÂ X

Tree View is being migrated from the [lab](https://mui.com/material-ui/about-the-lab/) to MUIÂ X, it will soon have a first Alpha release!

The Tree View is a component that represents hierarchical in a tree-like format.
Think of a file system navigator displaying folders and files or a navigation list.

<video autoplay muted loop playsinline width="1500" height="554">
  <source src="/static/blog/mui-x-mid-v6-features/treeview.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Keep on the look out on our next blog for the Tree View migration.

We decided to migrate this component to MUIÂ X as there are still many features that would be great to build (for example checkbox, drag & drop, virtualization) and it's usually not a significant component of a design system.
Head to [MUIÂ Core vs. MUIÂ X](https://mui-org.notion.site/X-FAQ-c33e9a7eabba4da1ad7f8c04f99044cc) if you would like to learn more about this decision.
