Here are the most significant improvements in October:

- 🔍 We have introduced a new autocomplete / combo box / multi-select component [in the lab](/material-ui/react-autocomplete/).

  <p class="blog-description">Combo box (limited options)</p>

- 📚 We have changed the demos to automatically inline a small code preview when possible.

- ♿️ We have fixed 9 accessibility issues ([#18141](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/18141), [#18142](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/18142), [#17972](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/17972), [#18146](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/18146), [#17939](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/17939), [#17892](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/17892), [#17897](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/17897), [#17870](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/17870), [#18204](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/18204)).

- 📦 We have introduced [codesandbox-ci](https://ci.codesandbox.io/status/mui/material-ui/pr/18238). It can be useful when you want to live on the edge. For instance, you might want to rely on an unreleased commit that contains a bug fix.

But this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 182 commits from 68 different contributors. We have changed 1,157 files with 31,312 additions and 9,771 deletions.

## Our roadmap intent for November

_(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)_

- 💅 We will initiate an update of our styling solution.
  It should cover styled-component [#6115](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/#6115), MUI System [#15561](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/15561), dynamic props [#15573](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/15573) and an unstyled version [#6218](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/6218).

- 📅 We will start to work on a [major upgrade](https://github.com/mui/material-ui-pickers/issues/1293) of the date/time picker components.

- 🧮 We will start to work on a data table component. The core will be open-source. The advanced features of the data grid will be behind an enterprise subscription ⭐️.
  This is an effort [of our roadmap](/material-ui/discover-more/roadmap/) to better answer enterprise needs. To get a rough idea of what's coming, you can read: https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356.

- ❓ Please upvote our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues) if you want something specific. The number of 👍 helps us to prioritize.

These are three major efforts, we will likely need the whole quarter (Q4) to make significant progress. Stay tuned.
