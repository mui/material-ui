## Challenge

As the energy sector undergoes rapid transformation, CGI needed a high-performance, scalable GUI to support Techyon's advanced capabilities. Their key challenges included:

- Performance Issues – Handling massive datasets (over 10 terawatts of data in Google Cloud) efficiently.
- Usability & Consistency – Creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface for energy operators and analysts.
- Slow Development Speed – Ensuring developers could quickly build and iterate on the UI.
- Developer Consistency – Standardizing the design approach across teams.

## Solution

CGI adopted MUI X Premium Data Grid as the foundation for Techyon's GUI, providing:

- A seamless, modern UI for managing workflows and energy data.
- High-performance data handling, even with tens of thousands of rows displayed at once.
- Structured, easy-to-use components, enabling developers to build interfaces effortlessly.
- A consistent design system, ensuring a professional and unified look across the platform.

## Results

After implementing MUI X, the Techyon team experienced:

- Instant performance improvements – Large datasets loaded smoothly, eliminating lag.
- A streamlined design process – Developers could create polished interfaces without needing a design background.
- Faster development cycles – MUI X's well-documented components simplified UI implementation.

## Developer Experience & Best Practices

CGI's team found MUI X's documentation to be clear, organized, and developer-friendly, making it easy for both new and experienced developers to integrate and optimize components.

Pro Tip from CGI: For developers handling large datasets, MUI X's Data Grid is highly optimized, but profiling your UI and using pagination or lazy loading can further enhance performance.

## Recommendation

For teams looking to build data-heavy applications efficiently, CGI highly recommends MUI X as a powerful, time-saving solution. Its advanced components (such as grids, filters, and tables) provide both flexibility and enterprise-grade performance.
Before MUI X, the team struggled with performance bottlenecks when handling large datasets without pagination—leading to slow load times and poor user experience.

- Switching to MUI X Data Grid was a game-changer:
- Instant data loading – No more sluggish UI.
- Custom filtering & real-time adjustments – Meeting client needs with ease.
- Scalability & flexibility – Adapting effortlessly to industry demands.
