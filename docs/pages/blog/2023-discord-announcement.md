This year, one of our highest priorities has been to create a central hub for the MUI community.
Majority of our discussions and interactions with you have been through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MUI_hq), [GitHub](https://github.com/mui), and [marketing page](https://mui.com/).

That's why we've officially launched our [Discord Server](https://mui.com/r/discord/)—and we'd love for you to be a part of our community!

Come join to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with the MUI team as well as developers just like you from all around the world.

## Why you should join our Discord Server?

There are a plethora of reasons why you should join, but here are the three biggest benefits:

1. **Real-time communication with our community**:
   As mentioned above, our communication with the community has often been slow and scattered across too many different platforms.
   Members would either file an issue on Github, tweet us, or send us a message directly on our website.

   _Discord provides real-time chat capabilities_, allowing you to communicate and collaborate with us and other members, instantly.

   What's a better way to get a real-time response from the MUI team and MUI users?!

2. **Community building**:
   Want to hear what MUI team is up to?
   Get the latest update with the products you're using?
   Want to give us real-time feedback?
   Heck, do you want to see if other's are facing the same issue you're having?
   Discord is a great place for us to get together and chat(Keep on the lookout for #voice-meetups)!

3. **Networking and collaboration opportunities**:
   We want this to be a safe place where you can join, have fun, and meet new people.
   Someone is out there using this same tool as you(_ahem_, MUI).
   We created two awesome channels to help you find work opportunities (and we can always create more—just let us know what you need)!
   1. 🎨 │ Show-Off
      - Show off your MUI projects! Get wild. Ask questions.
        If you have MUI related questions that is blocking you from your project, ask here.
        Someone may be facing it as well.
        Or use this channel simply to boast. 😉
   2. 📝 │ Freelance
      - Looking for some help on completing your vision?
        Use this channel to find work or market yourself for work.
        There are thousands of developers, designers, and teams using MUI.
        You're bound to find someone to help you complete your project.

Overall, Discord's combination of real-time communication, community building features, organizational capabilities, and developer-friendly features make it a valuable tool for our community to connect, collaborate, and grow together!
