Creating a place where we can interact with our community has been our priority for this year. Majority of our discussions and interactions with you have been through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mui_hq), [GitHub](https://github.com/mui), and [marketing page](https://mui.com/).

We have officially launched our [Discord Server](https://mui.com/r/discord/) and would love for you to be part of our community.

Come join to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with the MUI team and others!

## Why you should join our Discord Server?

There are a plethora of reasons why you should join, but ultimately, it came down to 3 things:

1. **Real-time communication with our community**: As mentioned above, our communication with the community was quite slow. Members would either file an issue on Github, tweet us, or send us a message directly on our website. Discord provides real-time chat capabilities, allowing you to communicate and collaborate with us and other members, instantly. What's a better way to get a real-time response from the MUI team and MUI users?!

2. **Community building**: Want to hear what MUI team is up to? Want to hear the latest update with the products you're using? Want to give us real-time feedback? Heck, do you want to see if other's are facing the same issue you're having? Discord is a great place for us to get together and chat(Keep on the lookout for #voice-meetups)!

3. **Networking and collaboration opportunities**: We want this to be a safe place where you can join and have fun. We all have something in common, whether it is building great products using MUI or curious . We created two awesome channels(We can create more, just tell us!)
   1. 🎨 │ Show-Off
      - Show off your MUI projects! Get wild. Ask questions. If you have MUI related questions that is blocking you from your project,you never know someone may be facing it as well. Or use this channel to simply boast 😉.
   2. 📝 │ Freelance
      - Looking for some help on completing your vision and using MUI? Use this channel to find work or market yourself for work. We have over 1000s of developers and designers using MUI. You're bound to find someone to help you complete your project.

Overall, Discord's combination of real-time communication, community building features, organizational capabilities, and developer-friendly features make it a valuable tool for our community to connect, collaborate, and grow together!

**See you on our [Discord Server!](https://mui.com/r/discord/)**
