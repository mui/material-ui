## Challenge

Before adopting MUI X, the Delivery Hero team faced two major challenges:

- Slow development speed – Building and refining UI components took too much time.
- Usability and consistency – Ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for end users was difficult.

## Solution

To address these challenges, the team integrated the MUI X Pro Date and Time Pickers and Data Grid Pro into their platform.
These components enabled them to:

- Accelerate development – Pre-built, high-quality components reduced time spent on UI implementation.
- Enhance usability – A modern, sleek UI improved user interactions and consistency.
- Optimize performance – The solution provided a smooth experience for restaurant and shop managers.

## Results

After implementing MUI X, the team saw immediate benefits:

- Faster feature development with less effort.
- Improved UI/UX consistency across the platform.
- Reduced user clicks when interacting with date and time inputs.

## Documentation experience and feedback

The team also praised MUI X's documentation, describing it as clear, well-structured, and easy to follow, which helped their developers integrate and customize components effortlessly.

## Recommendation

For developers looking to build modern, high-performance UI components with minimal effort, the Delivery Hero team highly recommends MUI X.

One key success story was the implementation of the Date Time Picker, which significantly reduced the number of clicks required for users to achieve their desired results.
This simple enhancement greatly improved user efficiency and satisfaction.
