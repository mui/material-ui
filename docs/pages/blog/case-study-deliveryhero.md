## How DeliveryHero Partner Portal Streamlined Development with MUI X

---

DeliveryHero Partner Portal provides restaurant and local shop management solutions for the global food delivery market. Their platform equips vendors with the tools they need to manage operations efficiently, enhance customer experience, and optimize performance.

## Challenge

Before adopting MUI X, the DeliveryHero team faced two major challenges:

- Slow Development Speed – Building and refining UI components took too much time.
- Usability & Consistency – Ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for end-users was difficult.

## Solution

To address these challenges, the team integrated MUI X Pro Date and Time Pickers and Data Grid Pro into their platform. These components enabled them to:

- Accelerate Development – Pre-built, high-quality components reduced time spent on UI implementation.
- Enhance Usability – A modern, sleek UI improved user interactions and consistency.
- Optimize Performance – The solution provided a smooth experience for restaurant and shop managers.

## Results

After implementing MUI X, the team saw immediate benefits:

- Faster feature development with less effort.
- Improved UI/UX consistency across the platform.
- Reduced user clicks when interacting with date and time inputs.

> "By leveraging MUI X Date Time Picker and Data Grid Pro, we have been able to provide our customers with cutting-edge, well-designed features in a shorter development time and with less effort." – Ahmed Ibrahim, Senior Manager Software Engineering | Vendor Growth, Delivery Hero

## Documentation Experience & Feedback

The team also praised MUI X's documentation, describing it as clear, well-structured, and easy to follow, which helped their developers integrate and customize components effortlessly.

## Recommendation

For developers looking to build modern, high-performance UI components with minimal effort, the DeliveryHero team highly recommends MUI X.
One key success story was the implementation of the Date Time Picker, which significantly reduced the number of clicks required for users to achieve their desired results. This simple enhancement greatly improved user efficiency and satisfaction.
