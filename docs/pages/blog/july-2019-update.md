- ⚛️ We have introduced a codemod that makes it easy to migrate to top-level imports.
  Read our [Minimizing Bundle Size](/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/) guide to learn how your project should be configured.

  ```js
  import { Button, TextField } from '@mui/material';
  ```

- ⭐️ We have introduced a new [Rating component](/material-ui/react-rating/) in the lab.

But this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 146 commits from 54 different contributors. We have changed 2,004 files with 29,022 additions and 25,455 deletions.

## Our roadmap intent for August

_(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)_

- 🔍 We will work on providing ready-to-use autocomplete, combo box, and multi-select components.

- 🦴 We will continue to work on a new Skeleton component. You can already [preview it](https://deploy-preview-16786--material-ui.netlify.app/components/skeleton/).
