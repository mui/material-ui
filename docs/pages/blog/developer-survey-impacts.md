## About the community

### Which of the following best describes your current job role?

As in the previous survey, most of the community members identified themselves as full-stack developers and represent today 41% of the total; that number was 52% that year, so we might be seeing a trend of specialization on front-end development, which increased 5%.
Overall, the community is more diverse, and virtually every other category had their representation increased this year.

{{"chart": "2024/CommunityJobs"}}

<p class="blog-description">1907 respondents.</p>

### How did you first hear about MUI?

The majority of community members heard about MUI through their workplaces, indicating MUI's widespread use in various companies. Interestingly but not surpring, a substantial number of people are learning about MUI through online videos.
We plan on starting doing some videos as well, but we'd like to leave a big shout-out to all MUI-content creators out there:

Thank you, and let us know what you're making!

{{"chart": "2024/FirstHearAboutMUI"}}

<p class="blog-description">1895 respondents.</p>

### What are you building?

Almost half of the community, around 45%, are engaged in building enterprise products on a variety of usages; 41% are involved in user-facing dashboards, and 35% are using MUI products to quickly build internal tools.

{{"chart": "2024/WhatCommunityIsBuilding"}}

<p class="blog-description">1899 respondents.</p>

### Who are you building the app for?

Very similar to the previous survey, a significant proportion of the community (65%) is developing products for the companies they work at, but we've seen a significant rise in work for clients, from 12% previously to over 45% in 2022.

{{"chart": "2024/WhoCommunityBuildsFor"}}

<p class="blog-description">1896 respondents.</p>

## About Your Needs

### How disappointed would you be if you could no longer use MUI libraries?

If MUI ceased to exist, 64% of the community would be very disappointed. A very slight increase compared to the previous survey.
This rise is within the survey's margin of error, though. Our goal is to continuously focus on user feedback and innovating our offerings to get a more significant increase in the future.

{{"chart": "2024/HowDisappointingWithoutMUI"}}

<p class="blog-description">1163 respondents.</p>

### How likely is it that you would recommend MUI to a friend or colleague?

Just over half of the community, 51%, would recommend MUI to others.
We deeply appreciate this show of support and trust!

Nonetheless, we acknowledge that there is room for improvement.
Our NPS decreased 6 points, and roughly 5% of the community stopped being a promoter to be a passive user.

{{"chart": "2024/HowLikelyToRecommend"}}

<p class="blog-description">1163 respondents.</p>

### What are your most important criteria for choosing a UI library?

When it comes to community priorities for choosing a library, “design and look and feel” still ranks first when looking the percentages for the first priority. But overall, documentation quality reached for the first time the highest score. The score is based on the weight of the option overall in all the answers.
Documentation along with design and customizability, are paramount to both the community and MUI.

{{"chart": "2024/MostImportantCriteriaToPickLibrary"}}

<p class="blog-description">1151 respondents.</p>

### How satisfied are you with MUI products?

We're happy to see how satisfied you're with Material UI.
Almost 90% of the respondents would use it again, and most of the community seem to be increasingly interested over all the other MUI products.

On a side note, 65%, a significant portion of the community, has not yet heard about Toolpad, and 40% have not discovered Joy.
It is crucial for us to increase the visibility of these tools and encourage more community members to try them out.
We also see a big opportunity to reach those that are already interested in trying other MUI products.

{{"chart": "2024/HowSatisfied"}}

<p class="blog-description">1161 respondents.</p>

### What is the main benefit you receive from using MUI libraries?

With a significant 41% of respondents highlighting 'Fast development' as a benefit, it is clear that developers and businesses are seeking solutions that streamline processes and reduce the time to market.

14% of participants emphasized the importance of a 'Large portfolio of quality components'. But 'Design / Look and Feel' is the second most flagged benefit, with 30% of participants mentioning MUI out-of-the-box UI/UX.

Surprisingly, only 3% explicitly mentioned Material design as a requirement for their projects.

The following chart is the top 20 most flagged benefits.

{{"chart": "2024/BenefitsMUI"}}

<p class="blog-description">826 respondents</p>

### How can we improve MUI for you?

There's a clear desire for More components, and Charts is the top1 mention in this regard.
But the community is also mostly interested in more examples, more customization and a better way to apply custom themes and styles.

We hear you, and we've already started many efforts to cover this gap, like the new documentation to guide you on customizing your [themes](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/).

Here are the Top 25 Categorized community requests.

{{"chart": "2024/HowCanWeImproveMUI"}}

<p class="blog-description">716 respondents</p>

### Please rate the following statements (our differentiators)

We are pleased to know that 88% of the community finds it easy to create visually appealing UIs using MUI.
However, we are keen to understand and address the concerns of the 10% who find the components not as easily customizable; we passionately want to fix your pain points, and we're exploring BaseUI and other solutions to bring a concrete answer to your needs.

{{"chart": "2024/MUIDiferentiators"}}

<p class="blog-description">1107 respondents</p>

### Please rate the following statements (our initiatives)

We were surprised with the number of people that would benefit from kitchen sink examples (47%), so we're working to bring more of them, and we're super glad to see that more than 50% of you are excited to see Joy UI.

Also, over 78% of you think it'd be good to have a discord server, so we've finally launched one. Join our [new community hub](https://mui.com/r/discord/)!

Another point worth noticing is that a good share of the community would also gladly have the opportunity to pay for support on the Core components.
We're now testing a priority support offering that covers Material UI, Base UI and Joy UI as well as MUI X components. The plan is still on pilot, but we hope to be able to make it public soon.

<p class="blog-description">1094 respondents.</p>

## Community workspaces

### Where is your company based? (Country or Region)

Almost a quarter of the respondents are based in the US, but this data doesn't match exactly the user traffic we have in our doc pages.
This likely means that the channels we use to reach the community might be a bit biased.

{{"chart": "2024/WhereAreCompaniesBased"}}

<p class="blog-description">1068 respondents</p>

### How many front-end or full-stack developers are on your team?

Teams with more than 5 developers are the most common, followed by teams with a single developer responsible for UIs.

## Community technical environment

### How experienced do you consider yourself in the following technologies?

Most developers are comfortable with Javascript and React. However, we see a drop in the level of comfort when it comes to CSS and MUI libraries, suggesting the need for more resources or support in these areas.

{{"chart": "2024/HowComfortableWithTechnologies"}}

<p class="blog-description">1077 respondents.</p>

### What styling solutions are you using?

It is encouraging to see that 79% have adopted the MUI System to build styles, indicating a positive shift away from the legacy style system.

## Experience with MUI X

### Are you using MUI X components (Data Grid or Date Pickers)?

Over 65% of the community uses MUI X components, showcasing the popularity and validating the need for these components. We're working to increase our advanced components portfolio to supply other community demands.

{{"chart": "2024/UsingMUIX"}}

<p class="blog-description">1108 respondents.</p>

### What benefits do you get from the Data Grid?

The survey results highlight that development speed is an important benefit the community get.
Surprisingly, column management emerged as the top use case among users of the commercial plans.
The community seem to value a lot the ability to effectively control and manipulate data presentation on the user level.

{{"chart": "2024/BenefitsDataGrid"}}

<p class="blog-description">323 respondents.</p>

### How can we improve MUI X for you?

There is a high demand for more components, features, and examples.
Efforts are underway to meet this demand and improve use case coverage.

We've already starting putting some gas on the development of new components, and we've recently launched the pre-release of [Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/) and [Treeview](https://mui.com/x/react-treeview/) (in fact, some of the charts you see on this report were developed using MUI X Charts).

Your Feedback also indicate a specific pain point with server-side integration, which is now being addressed as a priority in our plans for 2023.

All our licenses, MIT and Commercial, are already perpetual in production.
But we understand the importance of providing a perpetual alternative in development mode, as indicated by 77% of the community. Considering your feedback, We're bringing more alternative to the current model, so you can use MUI X libraries on the model that best suits your requirements. You can already access a perpetual in development license in our [pricing page](https://www.mui.com/pricing/).

<p class="blog-description">436 respondents.</p>

## Perception of low code tools

### How familiar are you with low-code development tools?

Our survey revealed that over 60% of respondents have not been exposed to low-code tools yet, and among those who have used these tools, a slight majority indicated they would not use them again. This feedback presents a significant opportunity to identify and address the challenges professional developers face with low-code tools.

{{"chart": "2024/LowCodeToolsFamiliarity"}}

<p class="blog-description">955 respondents.</p>

### What are your 3 most important features in a low-code tool to build admin apps?

The ability to import and export code freely and easily emerged as a key expectation for low code for our community members, along with great documentation and look and feel of the output. We are attempting to address them through [MUI Toolpad](https://mui.com/toolpad/).

{{"chart": "2024/MostImportantLowCodeTools"}}

<p class="blog-description">467 respondents.</p>
