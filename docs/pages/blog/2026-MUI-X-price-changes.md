Beginning **April 8, 2026**, we're introducing updates to MUI X pricing and licensing. These changes are designed to give teams more flexibility as they scale, expand licensing options to suit a wider variety of customers, and ensure we can continue investing in the long-term future of the MUI ecosystem.

## 🔄 Summary of changes

Changes include:

- Updated pricing for MUI X Pro and MUI X Premium
- Introduction of application-based licensing for Pro and Premium
- Enterprise plan remains multi-application (minimum 15 seats)
- Priority support available only to Enterprise customers
- Security questionnaires and custom agreements available for orders above $12,000 USD
- Premium self-service for purchases of up to 15 seats
- Grandfathering for existing **v8 license renewals**

## Why we're updating pricing

MUI X has grown significantly since its early days. While the MUI X Pro plan has evolved over the years, its pricing per developer has not significantly changed since it was first introduced in 2020—despite major feature additions, performance improvements, and ongoing maintenance.

As a result, this new pricing brings Pro closer in line with the value teams receive today, and allowing us to sustainably support its future development.

This post breaks down everything you need to know about the changes. You can also head directly to [the updated pricing page](https://deploy-preview-47606--material-ui.netlify.app/pricing/) for a thorough feature comparison.

## Grandfathering current customers

We value our loyal customers and want to ensure a smooth transition:

- Customers renewing existing **v8 licenses** or adding seats to v8 licenses are **not affected** by these pricing changes.
- Only customers upgrading to **v9** or moving from **Pro to Premium** will be affected.

If you're unsure how this applies to your team, please reach out to us at **sales@mui.com** and we'll be happy to clarify.

## What's changing in licensing

### Application-based licensing for Pro and Premium

MUI X Pro and Premium are moving to an **application-based licensing model**, giving teams more control over how licenses are used across projects.

Each developer must still be licensed, but you can now choose between **single-application** and **multi-application** licenses.

- The Enterprise plan is always multi-application and starts at a minimum of 15 seats.

## Support updates

Alongside pricing changes, we're updating how support is structured:

- Priority support is no longer available as a Premium add-on and will be exclusive to Enterprise customers.
- We will only respond to security questionnaires and provide custom agreements (including reviewing company-specific purchasing terms) for orders of **$12,000 and above** across all plans.
- MUI X Premium will be self-service for purchases of up to 15 seats. Purchase orders or email-based requests will only be accepted starting at 15 seats of MUI X Premium.
- All other purchases must be completed directly on our website.

## What's next

We'll be sharing exciting roadmap updates for **MUI X v9**—including version alignment between Material UI and MUI X—on our blog in the coming months.

We're deeply thankful for the continued support from our community and customers. These pricing updates allow us to keep pushing MUI X and the broader MUI ecosystem in ambitious new directions, while staying true to our open-source roots.
