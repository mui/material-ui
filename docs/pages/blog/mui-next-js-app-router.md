With [v5.14.0](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases/tag/v5.14.0), MUI's Core component librariesâ€”MaterialÂ UI, BaseÂ UI, and JoyÂ UIâ€”are now compatible with the Next.js App Router. ðŸš€

## Adapting to the new paradigm

React 18 introduced the concept of React Server Components, and Next.js 13 gave us the most mature framework implementation of RSCs to date with the App Router.
While these two changes have caused major waves among the React community, it's clear that this is the path forward, and it's our responsibility as library maintainers to adapt to the new paradigm.

As a first step towards this goal, we've updated all MaterialÂ UI, BaseÂ UI, JoyÂ UI, and MUIÂ System components to ship with the `"use client"` directive, to let your apps know that these are Client Components (since Server Components are now the default).

:::info
**A note on terminology:** although no MaterialÂ UI, BaseÂ UI, JoyÂ UI, or MUIÂ System components can be used as React Server Components (RSCs) at this time, they _do_ support server-side rendering (SSR).
See [this explanation of Client Components and SSR](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4) from the React Working Group for more details on the distinction between RSC and SSR.

Additionally, we've created guides to walk you through setting up an app using the Next.js App Router with each of the Core libraries:

- [MaterialÂ UI setup](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/next-js-app-router/)
- [BaseÂ UI setup](https://v6.mui.com/base-ui/guides/next-js-app-router/)
- [JoyÂ UI setup](https://mui.com/joy-ui/integrations/next-js-app-router/)

<img alt="Screenshot of the MaterialÂ UI documentation" src="/static/blog/mui-next-js-app-router/docs.png" loading="lazy" width="2400" height="1394" />

We also have example repos for each, with everything already set up for you:

- [MaterialÂ UI example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-nextjs-ts)
- [BaseÂ UI with TailwindÂ CSS example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/v6.x/examples/base-ui-nextjs-tailwind-ts)
- [JoyÂ UI example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/joy-ui-nextjs-ts)

## What comes next

In the world of Server Components, "traditional" CSS-in-JS poses a serious challenge that may require us to move beyond Emotion, which is the default styling solution for MaterialÂ UI and JoyÂ UI in v5.
We're currently exploring ways to offer our own zero-runtime CSS-in-JS solution that will enable you to use relevant MUIÂ System, MaterialÂ UI, and JoyÂ UI components as Server Components.
This will also have the added benefit of improving performance across the board.
Keep an eye out for an RFC from us very soon that will detail the proposed solution.

In the meantime, please let us know if you have any questions or encounter any issues when using MaterialÂ UI components, MUIÂ System, or JoyÂ UI with the Next.js App Router.
