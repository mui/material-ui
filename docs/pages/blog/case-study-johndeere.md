## How John Deere Standardized UI Development with MUI X

John Deere is a global leader in agricultural, construction, and forestry machinery. With a strong emphasis on innovation, their teams build solutions that enhance efficiency and productivity across industries.

## Challenge

With multiple teams working towards different design goals, maintaining consistency for developers was a major challenge. John Deere needed a reliable, standardized component library to bridge the gaps in their internal design system.

## Solution

By integrating MUI X Premium Data Grid, John Deere's teams found a baseline of standardized components to rely on, ensuring a cohesive development approach where their Fuel Design System didn't provide the necessary coverage.

## Results

✅ Improved Consistency – Developers could use MUI X as a standardized foundation across teams.
✅ Faster Development – Teams saved time by leveraging ready-to-use, high-performance components.
✅ Enhanced Flexibility – MUI X filled in the gaps where the internal design system fell short.

## Documentation Experience & Feedback

While the MUI X documentation was useful, the team found it challenging to understand recent pricing changes and how to forecast costs for various groups using the tool.

## Recommendation

For developers working with John Deere's Fuel Design System, MUI X is a great complement when additional features or components are needed.
A notable experiment involved testing heatmaps with their current key to determine the watermark for non-grandfathered functionality—an innovative approach to balancing licensing considerations with usability needs.

> "MUI X has provided us with a baseline of standardized components to rely on where our design system may not necessarily fill a needed gap." – Tyler Mitchell, Engineering Manager, John Deere
