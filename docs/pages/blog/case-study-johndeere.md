## Challenge

With multiple teams working towards different design goals, maintaining consistency for developers was a major challenge.
John Deere needed a reliable, standardized component library to bridge the gaps in their internal design system.

## Solution

By integrating MUI X Premium Data Grid, John Deere's teams found a baseline of standardized components to rely on, ensuring a cohesive development approach in places where their in-house Fuel Design System didn't provide the necessary coverage.

## Results

- Improved consistency – Developers could use MUI X as a standardized foundation across teams.
- Faster development – Teams saved time by leveraging ready-to-use, high-performance components.
- Enhanced flexibility – MUI X filled in the gaps where the internal design system fell short.

## Recommendation

For developers working with John Deere's Fuel Design System, MUI X is a great complement when additional features or components are needed.
A notable experiment involved testing heatmaps with their current key to determine the watermark for non-grandfathered functionality—an innovative approach to balancing licensing considerations with usability needs.
