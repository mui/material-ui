# Head of Operations

<p class="description">You will take ownership of designing, implementing, and overseeing most of the business operations to support MUI's growth.</p>

## Details of the role

- **Location**: Remote (preference for UTC-6 to UTC+5).
- **Type of work**: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on circumstances](https://mui-org.notion.site/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501#494af1f358794028beb4b7697b5d3102)).
- We're a **remote** company, operating mostly asynchronously.

## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.
We're a company of 31+ people as of late 2023, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain.
Base UI is our headless component library, and Joy UI is a sister library to Material UI that implements our own in-house Joy Design system.
We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.

Learn more about MUI's products in this blog post: [An introduction to the MUI ecosystem](https://mui.com/blog/mui-product-comparison/).

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe.
The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate.
We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public.
Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.

For additional details about the culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

We have found market fit but we increasingly don't have the tools (in the broad sense) necessary to keep up with the requests from our users.
Up to recently, the founders of MUI were the only ones to work on business operations.
There is now a tiny team of two people working to support the operations needs.
But this isn't enough, the department is increasingly a bottleneck in growing the company.
We are looking for a Head of Operations to take ownership of designing, implementing, and overseeing most of the business operations to support MUI's growth.

Overall, both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

### Why this is interesting

Our approach to business operations is centered around operational excellence.
It involves relying on automation and writing custom code where necessary.
We are even building a product dedicated to improving internal tools for companies: https://mui.com/toolpad/ which we increasingly rely on internally.
You will likely use it a lot to improve processes.

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster – we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.

- Work toward SOC 2 certification.
- Migrate from Sendinblue to SendGrid.
- Oversee our US flip.
