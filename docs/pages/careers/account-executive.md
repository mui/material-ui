## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design. Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.

We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. Base UI is our headless component library, and Pigment CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe. The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate. We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public. Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.

## Why we're hiring

Currently, 100% of MUI's sales are inbound, and MUI boasts an impressive existing client base, with millions of developers having already downloaded MUI.

MUI now needs to recruit a Senior Account Executive who can lead the transition to outbound sales while also building and implementing sales processes and methodologies as the company expands.

This Senior Account Executive is not focused on aggressive hunting; instead, it is about being proactive in pursuing and creating deals and implementing sales frameworks with customers. This is a key hire for MUI because it involves collaborating with the leadership team to determine how sales can best support MUI.

To accelerate this growth, MUI needs to hire a Senior Account Executive, who, as MUI's first senior sales hire, will not only be responsible for selling MUI's products but will also primarily focus on defining, building, and implementing MUI's sales strategy and processes.

### Why this is interesting

As MUI continues to grow, the Senior Account Executive will not only close inbound leads, but will also work closely with both MUI customers and the MUI leadership team to define and implement sales strategies that increase average customer spending, renewal rates, and total contract value.

## The role

The Senior Account Executives aim will be towards implementing the strategies that lead to MUI's transition from a pure inbound sales business, into a hybrid inbound and outbound sales model.

### Key responsibilities

Depending on the day, you'll:

- **Hands-on Sales**.
  Actively engage in the full sales cycle, from lead generation and qualification to closing deals and managing client relationships. Focus on selling our developer licenses for advanced UI components.
- **Sales Strategy Development**.
  Collaborate with leadership to define and implement a comprehensive sales strategy, including target market segmentation, pricing strategies, and sales processes.
- **Sales Process Optimization**.
  Continuously evaluate and improve our sales processes, leveraging best practices and data-driven insights to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Sales Forecasting & Reporting**.
  Develop accurate sales forecasts, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide regular reports on sales performance to leadership.
- **Market Analysis**.
  Stay informed about market trends, competitor activities, and customer needs to identify opportunities and refine our sales approach.

## Who we're looking for

As our Senior Account Executive, you'll be a key player in our growth story. You'll be a hands-on sales contributor, closing deals and building relationships with key clients.

### Required

- To manage existing customers and qualify incoming leads with a focus on selling additional licenses, upselling/cross-selling, and increasing total contract value – building strong relationships with each customer.
- The Senior Account Executive will manage key customers with large accounts, and scan existing smaller accounts to upsell into them. Essentially ensuring users are successful by explaining the benefits of the MUI products to them
- MUI's typical customers are engineers, developers, Heads of Engineering Departments, CTOs, etc. The Senior Account Executive will need to develop an understanding of MUI's products to resonate with MUI's customers and will manage mid-market and enterprise sales cycles with multiple engagement points.
- The Senior Account Executive will be in active communication with the customers leading them into the onboarding process, working closely with customer success.
- MUI needs a Senior Account Executive who has sold either:
  - UI interfaces/libraries and related technologies for front-end development
  - API and other Developer products
- The Senior Account Executive needs to have a track record of selling relevant tools and products to customers, with a history of success in upselling, cross-selling, increasing total contract values, and renewal rates of customers.
- The Senior Account Executive will consult and advise MUI's customers and then report relevant information/feedback back to the MUI team regarding points such as features that clients have asked for more information regarding.
- This will be the 1st Senior Account Executive hire for MUI. Therefore, this individual needs to be a self-starter, motivated, and able to work autonomously. Also, MUI is in the startup phase, not all processes will be defined, the Senior Account Executive needs to be comfortable working alone, and sometimes with activities that may extend outside of the job description.
- While startup experience is preferred, but certainly not essential, a startup, entrepreneurial and self-motivating mindset is essential.
- The Senior Account Executive needs to have the ambition to further learn and progress in their career, be open to communication, and be constantly interested in taking on further responsibilities.

### Nice to have (but not required)

- Existing network of contacts within the developer community.
- Familiarity with Open Core business models.
- Experience with sales automation tools.
- Participation in developer communities or events.
- A passion for cutting-edge technology and UI/UX.
