## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with MaterialÂ UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
Today, MaterialÂ UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.
We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, MaterialÂ UIâ€”but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain.
BaseÂ UI is our headless component library, and JoyÂ UI is a sister library to MaterialÂ UI that implements our own in-house Joy Design system.
We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUIÂ X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe.
The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate.
We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public.
Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.

For additional details about the culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

We are aiming to make high-end design accessible to the many, empowering developers that lack access to a designer as well as saving time for designers with a source they can trust.
[According to our last survey](https://mui.com/blog/2021-developer-survey-results/#what-are-your-most-important-criteria-for-choosing-a-ui-library), the quality of the design execution (UX & UI) is the most important criteria used by developers & designers to pick their next UI library.

Overall, both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast.
We need talented people to keep up with the demands of our exigent community!

### Why this is interesting

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.

But while we are [the leading](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#over-the-past-year-which-of-the-following-design-systems-was-your-favorite-go-to-solution) UI design system in the frontend space, the adoption of MUI is only at 25%. More importantly, the challenges of developers and designers to solve when creating UIs go way beyond the ones of design systems.
We envision a future where MUI becomes the default toolkit for web developers to create UIs.
It's why we started BaseÂ UI, JoyÂ UI, and Toolpad. Design is key to achieving this goal.

## The role

### Key responsibilities

Depending on the day, you'll:

- Work closely with our designers to prototype and implement new components, features, and screens.
- Design and build entire experiences for sites like mui.com or products like Toolpad.
- Concept and prototype UX components and motion studies for components like the date picker.
- Extend our different design systems (MaterialÂ UI, JoyÂ UI).
- Create appealing new demos in the docs.

## Who we're looking for

### Required

- 3+ years of relevant web front-end development experience at a tech-forward, product-driven company.
- Advanced knowledge of modern React, HTML, and CSS.
- Experience designing and building public-facing sites that work elegantly.

### Nice to have (but not required)

- A good understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion.

## Benefits and compensation

Competitive compensation depending on the profile and location.
We are ready to pay top market rates for a person who can clearly exceed the role's expectations.
You can find the other perks & benefits on the [careers](https://mui.com/careers/#perks-and-benefits) page.
