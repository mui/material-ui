## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design. Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.

We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. Base UI is our headless component library, and Pigment CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe. The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate. We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public. Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.

## Why we're hiring

Currently, 100% of MUI’s sales are inbound, and MUI boasts an impressive existing client base, with millions of developers having already downloaded MUI.

To accelerate this growth, MUI now needs to hire an Account Manager to manage existing customers and qualify incoming leads with a focus on selling additional licenses, upselling/cross-selling, and increasing total contract value – building strong relationships with each customer.

### Why this is interesting

As MUI continues to grow, the Account Manager will not only close inbound leads, but will also work closely with both MUI customers and the MUI leadership team to define and implement sales strategies that increase average customer spending, renewal rates, and total contract value.

## The role

The Account Managers will aim to support MUI’s existing client base and work to increase the average customer lifetime value.

### Key responsibilities

Depending on the day, you'll:

- **Account Management & Growth**.
  Develop and maintain strong relationships with key accounts, understanding their business goals and technical requirements. Identify opportunities to expand existing accounts through upselling and cross-selling.
- **Sales Cycle Management**.
  Manage the full sales cycle for assigned accounts, from lead qualification and product demonstrations to contract negotiation and closing.
- **Solution Selling**.
  Effectively communicate the value proposition of our UI components to technical and business stakeholders, demonstrating how our solutions address their specific needs.
- **Technical Understanding**.
  Develop a deep understanding of our product suite and the underlying technologies to effectively communicate with developers and technical decision-makers.
- **Customer Advocacy**.
  Act as a liaison between customers and internal teams, ensuring customer satisfaction and resolving any issues promptly.
- **Sales Forecasting & Reporting**.
  Maintain accurate sales forecasts and provide regular reports on account activity and sales performance.

## Who we're looking for

As an Account Manager, you will be responsible for managing a portfolio of key accounts. You will act as a trusted advisor to our clients, understanding their needs, and providing tailored solutions that leverage our advanced UI components. You'll be a key contributor to our sales team's success, working closely with the Sales Team Lead and other team members.

### Required

- The Account Manager will manage key customers with large accounts, and scan existing smaller accounts to upsell into them. Essentially ensuring users are successful by explaining the benefits of the MUI products to them
- The Account Manager will guide customers from MUI Pro to MUI Premium, upselling additional features on top of the Premium offering.
- MUI’s typical customers are engineers, developers, Heads of Engineering Departments, CTOs, etc. The Account Manager will need to develop an understanding of MUI’s products to resonate with MUI’s customers and will manage mid-market and enterprise sales cycles with multiple engagement points.
- The Account Manager will be in active communication with customers leading them into the onboarding process and working closely with customer success.
- Therefore, MUI needs an Account Manager who has sold either:
  - UI interfaces/libraries and related technologies for front-end development
  - API and other Developer products
- The Account Manager needs to have a track record of selling relevant tools and products to customers, with a history of success in upselling, cross-selling, increasing total contract values, and renewal rates of customers.
- The Account Manager will consult and advise MUI’s customers and then report relevant information/feedback back to the MUI team regarding points such as features that clients have asked for more information regarding.
- This will be the 1st Account Manager hire for MUI. Therefore, this individual needs to be a self-starter, motivated, and able to work autonomously. MUI is in the startup phase, not all processes will be defined, the Account Manager needs to be comfortable working alone, and sometimes with activities that may extend outside of the job description.
- While startup experience is preferred, but certainly not essential, a startup, entrepreneurial and self-motivating mindset is essential.
- The Account Manager must have strong interpersonal and presentation skills and be confident in their ability to learn and achieve.

### Nice to have (but not required)

- Existing network of contacts within the developer community.
- Familiarity with Open Core business models.
- Experience with sales automation tools.
- Participation in developer communities or events.
- A passion for cutting-edge technology and UI/UX.
