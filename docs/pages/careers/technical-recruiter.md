# Technical Recruiter

<p class="description">MUI is looking for an experienced Tech Recruiter to join our People team. You'll hire top engineering and product talent, helping us scale our open-source company.</p>

## Details of the role

- **Location**: Remote (preference for UTC-6 to UTC+5).
- **Type of work**: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on circumstances](https://mui-org.notion.site/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501#494af1f358794028beb4b7697b5d3102)).
- **Level**: [IC4 or above](https://mui-org.notion.site/Leveling-at-MUI-5c30f9bfe65149d697f346447cef9db1)..

## You should apply if

- You are **ready to own the full recruitment cycle**.
- You have **5-8 years** of recruiting experience, with a strong background in technical R&D hiring.
- You are excited by the challenge of finding and attracting the right technical talent and **solving the problem**.
- You have **strong sourcing skills**; you regularly use platforms like LinkedIn Recruiter, GitHub, Boolean search, and other industry-specific tools.
- You're comfortable assessing the complexity and impact of a candidate's work — not just what they built, but how and why it mattered.
- You routinely collaborate with senior stakeholders, including top-level leadership and founders.
- You are ensuring fairness in hiring practices.

## You should not apply if

- You prefer a highly structured environment where processes are already fully defined; we're building as we grow.
- You avoid getting into the "weeds" of solving technical problems; you'll be hiring for complex R&D positions.
- You prefer a traditional in-office setting; this role is fully remote within a largely asynchronous culture.
- You're **not interested in contributing beyond core recruitment tasks**; we encourage broad impact and provide opportunities for you to define your responsibilities even outside of recruitment.

## About MUI

MUI's story began in 2014 with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design. Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.

We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

MUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. Base UI is our headless component library, and Pigment CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.

## About the People & Talent team

MUI is experiencing rapid growth across both our open-source community and our premium product offerings. To sustain this momentum and meet the demands of our dynamic community, we need to expand our talented team. Our People & Talent team currently counts 1 person who is taking care of both HR and talent needs. We need someone who will directly contribute to and own recruitment initiatives, as well as expand their knowledge and contribute to broader People-related topics. You will lead the recruitment effort with the help of our Talent and Culture Partner, acting as a strategic thought partner to our hiring managers and contributing to the overall growth of our organization.

We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public. Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.
