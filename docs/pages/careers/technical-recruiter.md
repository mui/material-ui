## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with MaterialÂ UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design. Today, MaterialÂ UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.

We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, MaterialÂ UIâ€”but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. BaseÂ UI is our headless component library, and PigmentÂ CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUIÂ X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe. The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate. We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public. Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.
