## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with MaterialÂ UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
Today, MaterialÂ UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.
We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, MaterialÂ UIâ€”but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain.
BaseÂ UI is our headless component library, and JoyÂ UI is a sister library to MaterialÂ UI that implements our own in-house Joy Design system.
We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUIÂ X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe.
The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate.
We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public.
Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.
