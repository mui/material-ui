## Multilines

:::info
The `AppRouterCacheProvider` component is responsible for collecting the CSS generated by MUIÂ System on the server, as Next.js is streaming chunks of the .html page to the client.

While it's not required to use the `AppRouterCacheProvider` component, it's recommended to use it to ensure that the styles are appended to the `<head>` and not rendering in the `<body>`.
See https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/26561#issuecomment-855286153 for why it's better.
