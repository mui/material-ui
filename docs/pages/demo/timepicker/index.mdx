## Time Picker

Time pickers use a dialog to select a single time (in the hours:minutes format).
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of the clock hand.

#### Basic usage
A time picker should adjust to a user’s preferred time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format.

<Example source={BasicTimePicker} />

#### Keyboard input

<Example source={KeyboardTimePicker} />

#### Inline mode

<Example source={InlineTimePicker} />

#### Static mode

It is possible to render any picker inline. This will be really helpful to build cutom popover/modal containers.
For that use `variant="static"`.

<Example paddingBottom source={StaticTimePicker} />

#### Seconds
Seconds input can be used for selection of a precise time point.

<Example source={SecondsTimePicker} />

#### Components API

<LinkedComponents components={['TimePicker', 'KeyboardTimePicker']} />
