## Challenge

As the energy sector was undergoing rapid transformation, CGI needed a high-performance, scalable GUI to support Techyon's advanced capabilities.
Their key challenges included:

- Performance bottlenecks – Handling massive datasets (over 10 terawatts of data in Google Cloud) without pagination—leading to slow load times and poor user experience.
- Usability and consistency – Creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface for energy operators and analysts.
- Development speed – Ensuring developers could quickly build and iterate on the UI.
- Developer consistency – Standardizing the design approach across teams.

## Solution

CGI adopted the **MUI X Data Grid Premium** as the foundation for Techyon's GUI, providing:

- A seamless, modern UI for managing workflows and energy data.
- High-performance data handling, even with tens of thousands of rows displayed at once.
- Structured, easy-to-use components, enabling developers to build interfaces effortlessly.
- A consistent design system, ensuring a professional and unified look across the platform.

## Results

After implementing MUI X, the Techyon team experienced:

- Instant data loading – No more sluggish UI, large datasets loaded smoothly, eliminating lag.
- A streamlined design process – Developers could create polished interfaces without needing a design background.
- Faster development cycles – MUI X's well-documented components simplified UI implementation.

## Developer experience

CGI's team found MUI X's documentation to be clear, organized, and developer-friendly, making it easy for both new and experienced developers to use components.

:::info
Pro tip from CGI: For developers handling large datasets, MUI X's Data Grid is highly optimized out of the box, but profiling your UI and using pagination or lazy loading can further enhance performance.
:::

For teams looking to build data-heavy applications efficiently, CGI highly recommends MUI X as a powerful, time-saving solution.
Its advanced components (such as grids, filters, and tables) provide both flexibility and enterprise-grade performance.
