            You have created a support request under the ["Priority Support"](https://mui.com/legal/technical-support-sla/#priority-support) terms, which is a paid add-on to MUI X Premium ⏰. Please validate your support key using the link below:

            https://tools-public.mui.com/prod/pages/jyhs86t?repo=mui-x&issueId=${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            Do not share your support key in this issue!

            Priority Support is only provided to verified customers. Once you have verified your support key, we will remove the `support: unknown` label and add the `support: priority` label to this issue. Only then the time for the SLA will start counting.
