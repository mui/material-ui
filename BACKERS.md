# Sponsors & Backers

<p class="description">Support Material-UI’s development through donations.</p>

Material-UI is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of these awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider:

#### What's the difference between Patreon and OpenCollective?

## Why?

If you run a business and are using Material-UI in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Material-UI development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained**.
It can also help your exposure in the Material-UI community and makes it easier to attract Material-UI developers.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Material-UI, consider donating as a sign of appreciation.
