# Sponsors & Backers

<p class="description">Support Material-UI’s development through donations.</p>

Material-UI is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of these awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider:
- [Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/oliviertassinari).
- [Become a backer or sponsor on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/material-ui).

#### What's the difference between Patreon and OpenCollective?

Funds donated via Patreon directly support [Olivier Tassinari](https://github.com/oliviertassinari)'s work on Material-UI.
Funds donated via OpenCollective are managed transparently and will be used for compensating work and expenses for core team members.
Your name/logo will receive proper recognition and exposure by donating on either platform.

## Why?

If you run a business and are using Material-UI in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Material-UI development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained**.
It can also help your exposure in the Material-UI community and makes it easier to attract Material-UI developers.
