## CSS API

You can overrides all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `actionSpacing`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes)
section for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
