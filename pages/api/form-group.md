# FormGroup

`FormGroup` wraps controls such as `Checkbox` and `Switch`.
It provides compact row layout.
For the `Radio`, you should be using the `RadioGroup` component instead of this one.

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| children | node |  | The content of the component. |
| classes | object |  | Useful to extend the style applied to components. |
| row | bool | false | Display group of elements in a compact row. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/guides/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `row`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/Form/FormGroup.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiFormGroup`.
