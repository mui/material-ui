## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `expanded`
- `focused`
- `disabled`
- `content`
- `contentExpanded`
- `expandIcon`
- `expandIconExpanded`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/ExpansionPanel/ExpansionPanelSummary.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiExpansionPanelSummary`.

## Inheritance

The properties of the [&lt;ButtonBase /&gt;](/api/button-base) component are also available.
