## The idea behind the example

You can start using Material UI with minimal front-end infrastructure, which is great for prototyping. It uses [ESM CDNs](https://esm.sh/).
We discourage using this approach in production, though.
The client has to download the entire library, regardless of which components are used, affecting performance and bandwidth usage.
