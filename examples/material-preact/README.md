## The idea behind the example

The project uses Material UI with [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact),Which is lightweight 3kb alternative of React with the same modern API.

This example uses CRA with `react-app-rewired` for adding webpack aliases for preact.

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies are including [Emotion library](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) which is default style engine in Material UI v5.
