# Accessibility conformance reports

Each component is rated against WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA and documented at `<Component>/accessibility.md`.

## The status line

For each SC this indicates:

1. How well it conforms
2. Whether the library or user (the author) is responsible for conformance

```text
<conformance> · <responsibility>
```

For example this:

```text
⚠️ Partially Supports · ● Component
```

Means:

1. Partially conforms
2. The component is fully responsible for WCAG conformance

## Conformance

Whether the component meets the applicable Success Criterion. [VPAT](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat) terminology is used:

| Symbol | Term               | Description                                     |
| :----- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Supports           | Met, no known defects.                          |
| ⚠️     | Partially Supports | Some functionality fails.                       |
| ❌     | Does Not Support   | Most functionality fails.                       |
| ➖     | Not Applicable     | The criterion does not apply to this component. |

A criterion is **flagged** (`🚩`, shown first in its status line) when its rating is assessed from the component's source but not yet confirmed by a test or recorded review. The flag concerns evidence, not conformance, and does not imply a defect.

## Responsibility

Whether the responsibility for meeting conformance is on the library, the author (library user), or shared.

| Symbol | Term      | Description                                                 |
| :----- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ●      | Component | Satisfied on its own.                                       |
| ◐      | Shared    | Satisfied when the component is used as documented.         |
| ○      | Author    | Depends on your implementation and the surrounding content. |

## Testing-method groups

Criteria are grouped by testing method, and roughly sorted by descending order of "human judgement required".

| Symbol | Group     | What it takes                                                                           |
| :----- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍     | Manual    | Human, visual, or assistive-technology judgment.                                        |
| 🔁     | Hybrid    | Automation catches regressions; judgment still needed.                                  |
| ⚙️     | Automated | A deterministic test proves it. `🚩` means such a test is feasible but not yet written. |

## Scope

Components are rated in isolation against WCAG 2.2 A and AA. The levels are [cumulative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance), that is, AA includes all of A.

## Not applicable by default

Most criteria about media, timing, or whole pages do not apply to a single component. A report lists them as not applicable with the reason below, unless its `accessibility.json` rates the criterion. To give a component its own reason, write the criterion region in its report.

## How it works

A report is a **claim**; a test is the **proof**. The two are kept apart on purpose: the reports are what the public page is built from, and CI's job is to stop a claim standing without proof behind it.

### The claim

A claim has three parts, and a person writes only what needs judgment:

- **`accessibility.json`** (in this folder) holds the library defaults: for each WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA criterion, the default rating, responsibility, testing-method group, and `🚩` flag, and whether it is [not applicable by default](#not-applicable-by-default).
- **`<Component>/accessibility.json`** holds only what differs from the defaults:

  | Key             | Meaning                                                                                                               |
  | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `criteria`      | `{ "<number>": { … } }`, the fields that differ from the default. Keying a default not-applicable criterion rates it. |
  | `notApplicable` | Criteria that do not apply to this component, beyond the defaults.                                                    |
  | `axe`           | The committed axe results for the component's demos.                                                                  |
  | `tests`         | Other components whose test files also test this one, such as `ButtonBase`.                                           |
  | `inherits`      | For a group component: the parent whose ratings it inherits. The group rates only the criteria it keys in `criteria`. |
  | `title`         | The display name, when it differs from the folder name.                                                               |

- **`<Component>/accessibility.md`** holds the prose: notes, manual testing steps, pass conditions, known-gap summaries, and the reasons a criterion does not apply. Write only between the `<!-- …:start -->` and `<!-- …:end -->` markers. The script generates everything else in the report and keeps that text when it regenerates it. A region can sit anywhere in the file, so to add an optional one, such as `<!-- 1.4.3:pass:start -->`, type its markers. A reason shared by several criteria takes a region named after all of them, such as `<!-- 3.3.1,3.3.3:start -->`.

To rate a new criterion, key it in the component's JSON file and run `pnpm a11y:scorecard`. The report gets empty regions for the prose it needs, and `pnpm a11y:scorecard:check` fails until you fill them in.

For a component that inherits, the Inherited row of the count table counts the criteria rated in the parent report. They are excluded from the Flagged ratio.

### The proof

Three kinds of test, none of which writes anything into a report. The scorecard reads which criteria each covers, so evidence is never listed by hand:

| Kind                    | Where                                                               | Covers                                                                                     |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests              | `<Component>/<Component>.test.js`, titled `it('2.1.1 Keyboard: …')` | Behavior: keyboard operation, focus order, pointer cancellation, accessible naming         |
| axe-core                | The docs demos, inside the Playwright loop                          | The mechanical layer: ARIA, labels, text contrast, target size                             |
| Playwright layout suite | `test/regressions/a11y/criteriaSuites.mjs`                          | What axe has no rule for: reflow at 320px, 200% text size, the WCAG text-spacing overrides |

- **Unit tests** count as evidence for a criterion when a test title starts with its number and WCAG name, such as `'2.1.1 Keyboard: …'` or `describe('4.1.2 Name, Role, Value')`. A title that names a criterion with the wrong name fails the check.
- **Playwright suites** are listed per component in `criteriaSuites.mjs`, which the regression tests also read.
- **axe results** are written to `docs/data/material/components/{slug}/{slug}.a11y.json` and committed, so a change that alters them fails CI. The WCAG tags that axe-core ships with each rule (for example, `color-contrast` has `wcag143`) map each rule to its criteria. A failing rule rates its criterion ⚠️ Partially Supports unless the component's JSON file sets another rating.

### The rollup

`pnpm a11y:scorecard` reads the defaults, every `<Component>/accessibility.json`, the tests, the axe results, and the prose regions, validates them, and regenerates these files:

- each `<Component>/accessibility.md` report, including its count table, known gaps, and not-applicable list, but keeping its prose regions
- the [Reports](#reports) table below, and the [not applicable by default](#not-applicable-by-default) list above
- the [manual checklist](./manual-testing.md)
- the summary table on the public [accessibility conformance page](../../../docs/data/material/getting-started/accessibility/accessibility.md), between its `scorecard` markers
- `docs/data/material/getting-started/accessibility/scorecard.json`, the machine-readable rollup

None of those numbers are typed by hand. Edit the JSON files or the prose regions, and re-run the command.

### What CI enforces

| Job                | Check                                                                       |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_unit`        | The unit tests pass.                                                        |
| `test_regressions` | axe and the layout suite pass, and the committed `*.a11y.json` still match. |
| `test_static`      | `pnpm a11y:scorecard:check`, described below.                               |

`pnpm a11y:scorecard:check` fails when:

- a data file has an unknown key or value, or a component override repeats its default
- a report does not account for each criterion exactly once: rated, inherited, or not applicable
- the generated files are out of date
- a report is missing prose it needs: notes for a 🔍 Manual or 🔁 Hybrid criterion, a summary for each known gap, or a reason for a criterion that is not applicable only for that component
- a prose region has no place in the report, for example after a criterion moves to Not applicable, so the next run would drop it
- a criterion is rated ⚙️ Automated while still flagged `🚩` or without a test, rated 🔍 Manual although a test covers it, or rated ✅ Supports by hand while an axe rule for it fails
- a component's own tests cover a criterion it calls not applicable

That is the link between claim and proof. The check confirms that a test names the criterion. It does not confirm that the test genuinely proves it. That judgment stays with the reviewer.
