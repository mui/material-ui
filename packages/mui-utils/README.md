# @mui/utils

Shared utilities used by MUI packages.

## Installation

`@mui/utils` is installed automatically when using packages like `@mui/material`,
so manual installation is usually not required.

Install manually only if you intend to import utilities directly:

```bash
npm install @mui/utils
```
